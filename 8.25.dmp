and\n\n        WHEREAS, these normally thin, slippery fluids are rendered thick and sticky, and rather than acting as\n\n lubricants, the cells affected by CF plug tubes, ducts, and passageways, especially in the lungs and pancreas;\n\n and\n\n        WHEREAS, CF affects roughlyseventythousand people around the world, and thirty thousand of those\n\n adults and children live in the United States; and\n\n        WHEREAS, advances in treatment and improvements leading to earlier detection of this disease have led to\n\n people living longer with CF and an increase in the number of people suffering from this debilitating condition;\n\n and\n\n        WHEREAS, throughout the world, more than half of those living with CF are children, and one thousand\n\n new cases of this disabling condition are diagnosed each year; and\n\n        WHEREAS, CF is a genetic defect, and in order for a child to have CF, both parents must carry the\n\n defective gene, which is recessive, and pass those flawed genes on to the child; and\n\n        WHEREAS, CF causes progressive damage to the respiratory system, and chronic digestive system\n\n problems are among the most common manifestations of CF; and\n\n        WHEREAS, respiratory damage is caused by mucus build-up in the lungs and bacterial infections which\n\n eventually lead to permanent lung damage, including the formation of scar tissue or fibrosis which impedes\n\n the ability of the lungs to inflate and deflate; and\n\n\n                                                        Page 1 of 2\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f     HR NO. 137                                      ENROLLED\n          WHEREAS, CF affects a specific protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance\n     regulator that controls the normal movement of chloride, as well as water, in and out of cells\n     throughout the body; and\n          WHEREAS, CF causes the ducts of the pancreas to become blocked, causing fibrosis of the\n     pancreas which causes reduced absorption of fat and vitamins and can result in "cystic fibrosis-related\n     diabetes";

and\n\n             WHEREAS, these normally thin, slippery fluids are rendered thick and sticky and rather than\n\n      acting as lubricants the cells affected by CF plug tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the\n\n      lungs and pancreas; and\n\n             WHEREAS, CF affects roughly seventythousand people around the world and thirty thousand of\n\n      those adults and children live in the United States; and\n\n             WHEREAS, advances in treatment and improvements leading to earlier detection of this disease\n\n      have led to people living longer with CF and increasing the population suffering from this debilitating\n\n      condition; and\n\n                WHEREAS, throughout the world, more than half of those living with CF are children and\n\n        one thousand new cases of this disabling condition are diagnosed each year; and WHEREAS, CF is a\n\n                                                genetic defect and in order for a child to have CF, both parents\n\n      must carry the defective gene, which is recessive, and pass those flawed genes on to the child in order\n\n      for the disease to manifest in the child; and\n\n             WHEREAS, CF causes progressive damage to the respiratory system and chronic digestive\n\n      system problems are among the most common manifestations of CF; and\n\n             WHEREAS, respiratory damage is caused by mucus build-up in the lungs, bacterial infections\n\n      and eventually leads to permanent lung damage, including the formation of scar tissue or fibrosis\n\n      which impedes the ability of the lungs to inflate and deflate; and\n\n             WHEREAS, CF affects a specific protein called cystic fibrosis trans-membrane regulator that\n\n      controls the normal movement of sodium chloride, as well as water, in and out of cells throughout the\n\n      body; and\n\n                                                      Page 1 of 2\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   SR NO. 104                                        ENROLLED\n                        WHEREAS, the affect of CF on the pancreas causes the ducts to become blocked,\n                   causing fibrosis of the pancreas which causes reduced absorption of fat and vitamins and can\n                   result in "cystic fibrosis-related diabetes"; and\n                        WHEREAS, almost half of all those affected with CF today are over eighteen years of\n                   age; and\n                        WHEREAS, infant blood screening to detect genetic defects is the most reliable and\n                   least costly method to identify persons likely to have CF; and\n                        WHEREAS, early diagnosis of CF permits early treatment and enhances the life\n                   expectancy as well as improving the quality of life of those living with CF; and\n                        WHEREAS, the average life expectancy of those with CF has been steadily\n                   increasing since the 1950s and is currently nearly forty years; and\n                        WHEREAS, a critical component of treating patients with CF includes access to\n                   innovative treatments which can effect both longevity and quality of life; and\n                        WHEREAS, improving both length and quality of life for people with CF begins with\n                   both earlier diagnosis and a greater awareness of the disease and its consequences.\n                        THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana\n                   does hereby designate the month of May 2016 as Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month in\n                   Louisiana.\n                        BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the\n                   Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of Louisiana.\n\n\n\n                                       PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE\n\n\n                                                        Page 2 of 2\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   Maryland\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   Michigan\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   Missouri\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   Missouri\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   Missouri\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\fVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   New Mexico\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   New York\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   New York\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   North Carolina\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   Oregon\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   South Carolina\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                                           Tennessee\n    HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 551\n            By Sexton C\n\n                   A RESOLUTION to commemorate May 2016 as Cystic Fibrosis Awareness Month.\n     WHEREAS, cystic fibrosis, commonly referred to as “CF,” is a genetic disease affecting\n approximately 30,000 children and adults in the United States and nearly 70,000 children and\n adults worldwide, more than 650 of whom live in Tennessee; and\n       WHEREAS, a defective gene causes the body to produce an abnormally thick, sticky mucus that\n\n clogs the lungs, and these secretions produce life-threatening lung infections and obstruct the pancreas,\n\n preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestines to help break down and absorb food; and\n       WHEREAS, more than 10 million Americans are symptomless carriers of the defective CF gene, and\n CF occurs in approximately one of every 3,500 live births in the United States; and\n       WHEREAS, the median age of survival for a person with CF is 39.3 years; and WHEREAS, with\n     advances in the treatment of CF, the number of adults with CF has\n steadily grown, and approximately 1,000 new cases of CF are diagnosed each year; and WHEREAS,\n     nearly fifty percent of the CF population is eighteen years of age and older,\n and people with CF have a variety of symptoms attributed to the more than 1,800 mutations of\n\n the CF gene; and\n       WHEREAS, infant blood screening to detect genetic defects is the most reliable and least costly\n\n method to identify persons likely to have CF; and\n\n       WHEREAS, early diagnosis of CF permits early treatment and enhances quality of life and longevity,\n\n as the treatment of CF depends on the stage of the disease and the organs involved; and\n       WHEREAS, clearing mucus from the lungs is an important part of the daily CF treatment\n regimen, and other types of treatments include inhaled antibiotics and pancreatic enzymes, among\n others; and\n       WHEREAS, there are seven world-class treatment centers in Tennessee that specialize in the\n diagnosis of CF and the care of persons with CF; and\n       WHEREAS, a critical component of treating patients with CF includes access to innovative\n treatments, which can play a crucial role in the lives of patients with CF; and\n      WHEREAS, improving the length and quality of life for people with CF starts with awareness;\n now, therefore,\n      BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINTH\n GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE\n CONCURRING, that we join with the many special organizations and healthcare professionals\n and facilities across Tennessee as they commemorate the month of May 2016 as Cystic Fibrosis\n\n Awareness Month.\n\n       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared for\n\n presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy.\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   Vermont\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   Wisconsin\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	2016_Proclamations_and_Resolutions_130-156.pdf	PDF	14	49	f	2017-08-14 04:49:31.512277	2017-08-21 07:03:00.136547	t	3426428	1	3.27 MB

Requirements shall be described in detail but also in easily\n\n          10              understandable language.\n\n          11          b) If a utilization review entity intends either to implement a new prior authorization\n\n          12              requirement or restriction, or amend an existing requirement or restriction, the\n\n          13              utilization review entity shall ensure that the new or amended requirement is not\n\n          14              implemented unless the utilization review entity’s Web site has been updated to\n\n          15              reflect the new or amended requirement or restriction.\n\n          16          c) If a utilization review entity intends either to implement a new prior authorization\n\n          17              requirement or restriction, or amend an existing requirement or restriction, the\n\n          18              utilization review entity shall provide contracted health care providers of written\n\n          19              notice of the new or amended requirement or amendment no less than sixty (60)\n\n          20              days before the requirement or restriction is implemented.\n\n          21          d) Entities utilizing prior authorization shall make statistics available regarding prior\n\n          22              authorization approvals and denials on their Web site in a readily accessible\n\n          23              format. They should include categories for:\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f            1                 (i) Physician specialty;\n\n            2                 (ii) Medication or diagnostic test/procedure;\n\n            3                 (iii)Indication offered; and\n\n            4                 (iv)Reason for denial.\n\n            5      Section IV: Utilization review entity’s obligations with respect to prior\n\n            6      authorizations in non-urgent circumstances. If a utilization review entity requires\n\n            7      prior authorization of a health care service, the utilization review entity must make a prior\n\n            8      authorization or adverse determination and notify the subscriber and the subscriber’s\n\n            9      health care provider of the prior authorization or adverse determination within two (2)\n\n          10       business days of obtaining all necessary information to make the prior authorization or\n\n          11       adverse determination. For purposes of this section, "necessary information" includes the\n\n          12       results of any face-to-face clinical evaluation or second opinion that may be required.\n\n          13       Section V: Utilization review entities’ obligations with respect to prior\n\n          14       authorizations concerning urgent health care services. A utilization review entity\n\n          15       must render a prior authorization or adverse determination concerning urgent care\n\n          16       services, and notify the subscriber and the subscriber’s health care provider of that prior\n\n          17       authorization or adverse determination not later than one (1) business day after receiving\n\n          18       all information needed to complete the review of the requested health care services.\n\n          19       Section VI: Utilization review entity’s obligations with respect to prior\n\n          20       authorization concerning emergency health care services.\n          21          a) A utilization review entity cannot require prior authorization for pre-hospital\n\n          22              transportation or for provision of emergency health care services.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f            1      b) A utilization review entity shall allow a subscriber and the subscriber’s health\n\n            2         care provider a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours following an emergency\n\n            3         admission or provision of emergency health care services for the subscriber or\n\n            4         health care provider to notify the utilization review entity of the admission or\n\n            5         provision of health care services. If the admission or health care service occurs\n\n            6         on a holiday or weekend, a utilization review entity cannot require notification\n\n            7         until the next business day after the admission or provision of the health care\n\n            8         services\n\n            9      c) A utilization review entity shall cover emergency health care services necessary\n\n          10          to screen and stabilize a subscriber. If a health care provider certifies in writing to\n\n          11          a utilization review entity within seventy-two (72) hours of a subscriber’s\n\n          12          admission that the subscriber’s condition required emergency health care services,\n\n          13          that certification will create a presumption that the emergency health care services\n\n          14          were medically necessary and such presumption may be rebutted only if the\n\n          15          utilization review entity can establish, with clear and convincing evidence, that\n\n          16          the emergency health care services were not medically necessary.\n\n          17       d) The medical necessity or appropriateness of emergency health care services\n\n          18          cannot be based on whether or not those services were provided by participating\n\n          19          or nonparticipating providers. Restrictions on coverage of emergency health care\n\n          20          services provided by nonparticipating providers cannot be greater than restrictions\n\n          21          that apply when those services are provided by participating providers.\n\n          22       e) If a subscriber receives an emergency health care service that requires immediate\n\n          23          post evaluation or post-stabilization services, a utilization review entity shall\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f            1             make an authorization determination within sixty (60) minutes of receiving a\n\n            2             request; if the authorization determination is not made within sixty (60) minutes,\n\n            3             such services shall be deemed approved.\n\n            4      Section VII. Retrospective denial. The utilization review entity may not revoke, limit,\n\n            5      condition or restrict a prior authorization for a period of 45 working days from the date\n\n            6      the health care provider received the prior authorization. Any language attempting to\n\n            7      disclaim payment for services that have been pre-authorized within that 45 day period\n\n            8      shall be null and void.\n\n            9      Section VIII. Waiver Prohibited. The provisions of this Act cannot be waived by\n\n          10       contract, and any contractual arrangements in conflict with the provisions of this act or\n\n          11       that purport to waive any requirements of this Act are null and void.\n\n          12       Section IX . Effective Date. This Act shall become effective immediately upon being\n\n          13       enacted into law.\n\n          14       Section X. Severability. If any provision of this Act is held by a court to be invalid,\n\n          15       such invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of this Act, and to this end the\n\n          16       provisions of this Act are hereby declared severable.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	_Policy_Toolkit_V2_Q12017_FINAL-Model_Bill_Language_176-183.pdf	PDF	15	52	f	2017-08-14 04:51:34.320671	2017-08-21 07:03:00.421847	t	122037	1	119 KB

                             5\n\f1         Introduction\n          This User’s Guide describes how to use the Intel® Management and Security Status\n          application. The application’s component tabs—detailed in this document—display\n          information about a platform’s support for the following technologies: Intel® Active\n          Management Technology (Intel® AMT), Intel® Small Business Technology (Intel® SBT),\n          Intel® Standard Manageability and Intel® Anti-Theft Technology (Intel® AT). All of\n          these technologies are built upon the Intel® Management Engine (Intel® ME), a\n          feature provided within the platform hardware.\n\n          The Intel® Management and Security Status icon indicates whether Intel® Active\n          Management Technology, Intel® Small Business Technology, Intel® Standard\n          Manageability and Intel® Anti-Theft Technology are running on the platform. The icon\n          is located in the notification area. By default, each time Windows* starts, Intel®\n          Management and Security Status application starts and the notification icon is\n          displayed.\n\n          The Intel® Management and Security Status application has a separate version per\n          every Intel® AMT generation (6.x, 7.x, 8.x, 9.x etc.). The installer for 9.x also\n          supports the 8.x generation. If the Intel® Management and Security Status application\n          starts automatically as a result of the user logging on to Windows*, the icon will be\n          loaded to the notification area only if a supported combination of the following\n          technologies is present on the platform: Intel® Active Management Technology, Intel®\n          Small Business Technology, and Intel® Standard Manageability. If the Intel®\n          Management and Security Status application is started manually (via the Start menu),\n          the icon is loaded even if none of these technologies are enabled.\n\n    Note: The information displayed in the Intel® Management and Security Status application is\n          not shown in real time.

The\nstatus can be one of the following:\n   Intel® AMT: Enabled / Disabled / Information unavailable\n       When Intel® AMT status presents Enabled it means that the Intel® AMT is\n    supported on the system. Intel® ME status (in the Advanced Tab) will give the\n    user information on whether the Intel® ME is configured (hence Intel® AMT is\n    functional and operating).\n       When Intel® AMT status presents Disabled it means that the Intel® AMT is\n    either not enabled on the system or has been disabled by the IT administrator.\n        Information unavailable: It is not known whether Intel® AMT is supported on\n    the system. No Intel® AMT information is available. This can be for one of the\n    following reasons: LMS service has stopped, or the Intel® Management Engine\n    Interface (Intel® MEI) driver is disabled.\n   Intel® SBT: Enabled / Disabled / Information unavailable\n       When Intel® SBT status presents Enabled it means that the Intel® SBT is\n    supported on the system. Intel® ME status (in the Advanced Tab) will give the\n    user information on whether the Intel® ME is configured (hence Intel® SBT is\n    functional and operating).\n       When Intel® SBT status presents Disabled it means that the Intel® SBT is\n    either not enabled on the system or has been disabled by the IT administrator.\n        Information unavailable: It is not known whether Intel® SBT is supported on\n    the system. No Intel® SBT information is available. This can be for one of the\n    following reasons: LMS service has stopped, or the Intel MEI driver is disabled.\n   Intel® Standard Manageability: Enabled / Disabled / Information unavailable\n       When Intel® Standard Manageability status presents Enabled it means that\n    the Intel® Standard Manageability technology is supported on the system. Intel®\n    ME status (in the Advanced Tab) will give the user information on whether the\n    Intel® ME is configured (hence Intel® Standard Manageability is functional and\n    operating).\n       When Intel® Standard Manageability status presents Disabled it means that\n    the Intel® Standard Manageability technology is either not enabled on the system\n    or has been disabled by the IT administrator.\n\n\n\n\n             10\n\f              Information unavailable: It is not known whether Intel® Standard\n           Manageability technology is supported on the system. No Intel® Standard\n           Manageability information is available. This can be for one of the following\n           reasons: LMS service has stopped, or the Intel MEI driver is disabled.\n          Intel® Anti-Theft Technology: Enabled. This means that the Intel® Anti-Theft\n           Technology feature is supported on the platform. If Intel® Anti-Theft Technology is\n           not supported on the platform; no reference to it is displayed. The feature\n           becomes activated only after the platform has been enrolled with an Intel® Anti-\n           Theft Technology service provider and all required configurations have been\n           applied.\n\nNote: The information in this field shows the state of the platform at the last platform boot.\n\n       Enable user notification: Checking this box allows the user to enable or disable the\n       Intel® Management and Security Status icon from displaying important notifications in\n       the notification area (for instance, notification will be sent when one of the\n       technologies is enabled or disabled). Checking or unchecking the checkbox affects the\n       Intel® Management and Security Status application setting for the current user\n       account only.\n\n       On Windows* 8 platforms, IMSS user notifications are also displayed as Windows* 8\n       UI ‘Toast’ notifications, visible to users working with the Windows* 8 UI. These\n       notifications will only be displayed as long as a Windows* 8 UI Start Menu shortcut\n       (Windows* 8 UI ‘tile’) is present.\n\n       Intel® Management and Security Status application will be available next\n       time I log on to Windows*: Checking this box causes the Intel® Management and\n       Security Status application to be invoked, and the icon to be displayed, whenever you\n       log on to Windows*. Checking or unchecking the checkbox affects Intel® Management\n       and Security Status application’s behavior for the current user account only.\n\nNote: The application does not load automatically with Windows* log-on if none of the\n      technologies it displays (Intel® Active Management Technology, Intel® Small Business\n      Technology or Intel® Standard Manageability) are supported on the platform. Intel®\n      Management and Security Status application will load automatically even if all of the\n      technologies are disabled, so long as they are supported. Intel ® Management and\n      Security Status application will not load if these technologies are not supported in the\n      platform.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             11\n\f3.2          Intel® Active Management Technology Tab\n      Note: This tab is displayed only if the platform supports Intel® AMT.\n\n             Click the Intel® AMT tab to display Intel® AMT information.\n\n\n\n\n Figure 3-2.\n\n\n\n\n                          12\n\f3.2.1     Fast Call for Help\n          The Fast Call for Help section provides Client Initiated Local Access (CILA) or Client\n          Initiated Remote Access (CIRA) capabilities depending on whether the system is\n          connected to the corporate network or not, respectively. The Fast Call for Help section\n          will be available for the CIRA/CILA use-cases, providing the proper configuration for\n          CIRA/CILA has been done, as well as for a case in which the user’s system did not\n          receive an IP address while the wireless network is available for a support session to\n          take place. Otherwise, the Fast Call for Help section will be grayed out.\n\n          CIRA allows a user to connect the Intel® AMT system to the company’s Information\n          Technology network from an external internet connection. Click the “Get Technical\n          Help” button to connect to your Information Technology network for system\n          diagnostics and maintenance.

Such settings are typically done by management software.\n          (Configuration details appear in the Intel® AMT SDK Implementation and Reference\n          Guide).\n\n    Note: The information displayed in the Intel® Management and Security Status application,\n          including the Fast Call for Help section, is not shown in real time. The data is\n          refreshed every time an event has arrived.\n\n    Note: When the user is connected as Guest account (in Windows*) the “Fast Call For Help”\n          section will be grayed out. This was designed to prevent users outside of the\n          organization to influence the organization network.\n\n\n3.2.2     Support Session Status\n          The following information is provided:\n              KVM Remote Control Connection\n\n              Indicates whether KVM (Keyboard, Video & Mouse) Remote Control session is open.\n              Possible values: Connected/ Disconnected/ Information unavailable.\n              The “KVM Remote Control Connection” section will be grayed out if the KVM Remote\n              Control feature is disabled on the system.\n              Media Redirection\n\n              Indicates whether there are any open IDE redirection sessions.\n              Possible values: Connected/ Disconnected/ Information unavailable.\n              Terminal and Keyboard Redirection\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 13\n\f          Indicates whether there are any open terminal/keyboard redirection sessions.\n          Possible values: Connected/ Disconnected/ Information unavailable.\n\n\n\n          Stop Sessions\n\n          Click the “Stop Sessions” button to close any open KVM Remote Control, media\n          redirection, or terminal/keyboard redirection sessions. In cases when user consent\n          is required for such a session, re-establishing the session will require renewal of\n          user consent after clicking this button.\n          Hot Key\n\n          Indicates the hot key which could be used to close any open KVM Remote Control,\n          media redirection, or terminal/keyboard redirection sessions (same effect as “Stop\n          Sessions” button).\n\n          Click on the “Change” button to choose a different hot key for terminating an open\n          session.\n          Prevent Access\n\n          This button will appear in cases where user consent is required for a remote support\n          session to occur. In such cases, after the user will provide the required approval to\n          the remote administrator and as long as the healing session hasn’t begun, the user\n          will see the “Prevent Access” button. This button enables the user to change his/her\n          mind, as clicking on it will cancel user consent and disable the ability of the IT\n          administrator to begin the remote session. During this time, the Hot Key will also\n          serve as a means to cancel user consent. Once a remote support session has\n          begun, the “Prevent Access” button will no longer be visible, and the “Stop\n          Sessions” button will appear instead.\n\n\n\n\nNote: User Consent, when required, will be granted to the administrator per session, by the\n      user giving the administrator a one-time pass code which will appear on the Secure\n      Output Window presented on the user’s screen.

The Restore Connection button enables the user to return\n            control of the wireless network to the OS. However, if this button is clicked while\n            the remote support session is still active, the session will be terminated.\n\n            This button is not shown on platforms from Intel ME 8.1 onwards.\n\n\n\n3.6.4   Network Information\n        Click the “Network Information” button to display network details regarding Intel® ME\n        wireless and wired connectivity.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               23\n\fFigure 3-8.\n\n\n\n\n         In the Connection Type section, click either Wireless Connection or Wired\n         Connection to display information on the following items for the selected interface:\n              Link Status\n\n              Whether the link is currently active.\n              Possible values are: Link up/Link down/Information unavailable\n              MAC Information\n\n              XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX – e.g. 88:88:88:0A:88:87\n\n\n\n\n                        24\n\f              IPv4 Address\n\n              XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX – e.g. 208.77.188.166\n              IPv4 Mode\n\n              Possible values: Static/ DHCP/ Information unavailable.\n              IPv6 address\n\n              If IPv6 addressing is enabled for the Intel ME, the Intel® Management and Security\n              Status application displays up to 6 IPv6 IP addresses configured for an Intel ME\n              network interface for wired connection, and up to 5 IPv6 IP addresses for wireless\n              connection.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3-9.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               25\n\f        Data which appears only for Wireless Connection\n\n\n            Configured for Wireless\n\n            Possible values are: Wireless enabled/ Wireless disabled/ Information unavailable.\n            WLAN control\n\n            On Intel ME 8.0 systems only, the WLAN control indicates whether the wireless\n            network is available to the user’s computer operating system (i.e. regular usage) or\n            whether it is in control of the Intel® Management Engine for the purpose of remote\n            support by an IT administrator. Possible values are: HOST / Intel® ME. This control\n            is not shown on platforms from Intel ME 8.1 onwards.\n            WLAN preference\n\n            On Intel ME 8.0 systems only, WLAN preference indicates whether the wireless\n            network should preferably be in control of the operating system or the Intel®\n            Management Engine (Intel® ME). Expected behavior is for WLAN control to be the\n            same as WLAN preference. However, if for some reason the operating system fails\n            to take control over the wireless network (e.g. the wireless driver is dysfunctional),\n            the user will witness WLAN preference given to the operating system while WLAN\n            control is with Intel® ME (even if the Return Control button was clicked).\n            Possible values are: Operating System/ Intel® ME. This control is not shown on\n            platforms from Intel ME 8.1 onwards.\n\n\n3.6.5   Extended System Details\n        When clicking Extended System Details, a Windows* System Information window will\n        open, providing an extensive report about system components and configuration.\n\n        The report includes both general information regarding the system (“Host\n        Information”) and specific Intel® Management Engine Information (“Intel® ME\n        Information”).\n\n        It is possible to save the system report to a file by clicking File->Export on the System\n        Information Window.\n\n        Below are explanations for some of the details displayed under Intel® ME Information:\n\n        Host information:\n            Operating System Name – The Windows* operating system that the application is\n             running on.\n            Operating System Version – The version of the operating system.\n            System Manufacturer – The hardware manufacturer.\n            System Name – The computer name as recognized by the operating system.\n            System Model – The hardware platform name.\n            Processor – The processor full brand name.\n\n\n                       26\n\f   BIOS Version – The BIOS manufacturer name and BIOS version number.\n   LAN Driver – The version number of the LAN device driver.\n   LAN DeviceID – The PCI Device ID for the LAN device.\n   WLAN Driver - The version number of the Wireless LAN device driver.\n   WLAN DeviceID – The PCI Device ID for the Wireless LAN device.\n\n\n\nIntel® ME Information:\n   Intel ME Control Mode – The configuration mode (Client Control or Admin Control).\n   Provisioning Mode – State of Intel ME configuration (Pre/In/Post).\n   BIOS boot – The BIOS boot state (expected to be Post Boot).\n   Last Intel ME reset reason - The reason that the Intel® ME was last reset (Global\n    System/ FW reset / Power Up/ Unknown cause/ Information unavailable).\n   System UUID – The Universal Unique Identifier of the computer.

Do one of the following:\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f       Windows:\n       Insert the DVD in your drive, then follow the on-screen instructions. If the installer does not\n       launch automatically, navigate to the Adobe Photoshop CS5 folder found at the root level on\n       the DVD and double-click Set-up.exe to start the installation process.\n       If you downloaded the software from the web, the installer will self-extract and launch\n       automatically. If the installer does not launch automatically, open the folder, navigate to the\n       Adobe CS5 folder, double-click Set-up.exe, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n       Mac:\n       Insert the DVD in your drive, navigate to the Adobe Photoshop CS5 folder found at the root\n       level on the DVD, double-click Install.app, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n       If you downloaded the software from the web, open the folder, navigate to the application\n       folder, double-click Install.app, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n   4. If you are installing as an upgrade, the installer will check your system to find a valid\n      upgrade product. If it cannot find one, it will ask you to input the serial number of the\n      product being upgraded. You can also install the software as a trial, then input your new and\n      previous serial numbers in the serialization screen shown during launch.\n   5. For additional CS5 installation help, go to www.adobe.com/go/cs5install/.\n\nAdobe Photoshop CS5 and Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended\n\nBoth Adobe Photoshop CS5 and Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended have the option to run natively in\neither 32-bit or 64-bit editions of Windows® Vista® Home Premium, Business, Ultimate, or\nEnterprise with Service Pack 2, Windows® 7 or Macintosh OSX v10.5.7 - 10.6.2.\n\nMacintosh 64-bit\n\nPhotoshop will automatically detect and run the 64-bit version on 64-bit Macintosh systems. To\nforce Photoshop to launch the 32-bit version, navigate to the application and "Get Info" (Control +\nClick on the application icon), then select the "Open in 32-bit mode" checkbox.\n\nMicrosoft® Vista® or Windows 7\n\nPhotoshop will automatically install the 32-bit version of Photoshop CS5 if you are on a 32-bit\nWindows OS. Photoshop will install both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Photoshop on 64-bit\nsystems. To install only the Photoshop 64-bit version on a 64-bit Windows OS, follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n   1. Run the Photoshop CS5 installer.\n   2. Enter your serial number. Click Accept.\n   3. On the right side of the Options panel under the 64-bit heading, uncheck the box for Adobe\n      Photoshop CS5. Leave the "Adobe Photoshop CS5 (64-bit)" option checked.\n   4. Finish installation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fKnown issues\n\n   •   On Mac, you cannot install to the root directory of the boot drive.\n   •   When installing on Vista64, an incorrect default installation location appears. The\n       application will be installed in the correct location: C:\\Program Files (x86).\n   •   The "Total Size" displayed in the Installer Options screen includes space required for\n       components required for the installation but NOT shown in the component list; the number\n       may not equal the listed components size.\n   •   For more detailed information about troubleshooting your installation, go\n       to www.adobe.com/go/support_loganalyzer.\n\nNote: In order to install additional components or reinstall your software after your original\ninstallation, you will need access to the original installer (CD, DVD or the download from the\nweb). Repair is not an available option.\n\n   •   If you are running Microsoft® Windows® XP with Service Pack 3, Photoshop will run in\n       both 32-bit and 64-bit editions. However, we do not officially support the 64-bit edition and\n       you may run into problems.\n   •   If you install Photoshop CS5 on your system and then install Photoshop CS4 afterward, you\n       will not in the future be able to use the Photoshop CS4 installer to repair your Photoshop\n       CS4 installation. To do the repair, you must uninstall Photoshop CS4 and then reinstall it.\n\nUninstall your software\nBefore you uninstall, close all applications currently running on your system (including other Adobe\napplications, Microsoft Office applications, and browser windows).\n\nDo one of the following:\n\n   •   In Windows® XP, open the Windows Control Panel and double-click Add or Remove\n       Programs. Select the product that you want to uninstall, click Change/Remove, then follow\n       the on-screen instructions.\n   •   In Windows® Vista® and Windows® 7, open the Windows Control Panel and double-click\n       Programs and Features. Select the product that you want to uninstall, click Uninstall, then\n       follow the on-screen instructions.\n   •   IMPORTANT: Mac OS has new uninstall functionality. DO NOT drag applications to the\n       trash to uninstall them. To safely uninstall on Mac OS X, double-click the product installer\n       in Applications/Utilities/Adobe Installers or double-click on the Uninstall alias located in the\n       Application folder. Select Remove Preferences, then Authenticate as an Administrator and\n       follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nNote: We allow you to install on two computers per serial number. If you have done so, but want to\ninstall the product on a new machine, you must first deactivate the software on one of your\ncomputers. To deactivate, either choose Help > Deactivate or check the Deactivate checkbox during\nthe uninstall process.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fTrial software\nEntering a serial number\n\nEnter the serial number for the software you purchased in the serialization screen. The serialization\nscreen will load the first time you launch the application. You can enter a serial number for the\napplication itself or a serial number for any Creative Suite that contains the application. If the\nproduct you purchased is one of the Creative Suites, you can enter the serial number in any of the\napplications contained in the Creative Suite. Other applications installed as part of the same Creative\nSuite will recognize the new serial number the next time the applications are launched.\n\nOnly applications running as a trial will recognize the new serial number. If any of the applications\nhave already been serialized with a different serial number, they will continue to use that serial\nnumber until you remove the older serial number using Help > Deactivate > Deactivate\nPermanently. After selecting this option, they will recognize the new serial number on the next\nlaunch of the application.\n\nThe serial number you purchased is for the use of the software in a specific language, and will only\nbe accepted by a product installed in that language.\n\nVolume licensing\n\nVolume licensing customers cannot purchase from a trial directly. However, a volume licensing\nserial number can be used to serialize all Creative Suite applications, except the Acrobat 9 trial or\nretail versions that ship with Creative Suite. Photoshop CS5 volume licensing software must be\npurchased from an authorized Adobe licensing center. Please contact your reseller or authorized\nAdobe licensing center to place an order for a volume license. To find a reseller in your area, go to\nhttp://partners.adobe.com/resellerfinder/na/reseller.jsp.\n\nElectronic licensing\nYou must accept the license agreement and warranty terms to use this product.\nSee www.adobe.com/go/eulas for details. This product may automatically attempt to activate over\nthe Internet. See www.adobe.com/go/activation for details.\n\nRegistration information\nCreating an Adobe ID registers your software and sets up access to Adobe CS Live online services.\nIn order to take advantage of your complimentary subscription of CS Live services, and get up-to-\ndate product information, training, newsletters, and invitations to Adobe events and seminars, you\nmust register your product.\n\nFont installation\nAll font related documentation is online. Visit\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/creativesuite/creativesuite5.html to find our OpenType\n                                                5\n\fUser Guide, OpenType Read Me, links to font-specific Read Me documents, listings of fonts\ninstalled by the different CS5 products, and listings of fonts included on DVD for each of the CS5\nproducts.\n\nThe Creative Suite 5 installer installs fonts into a default system font directory. Many of these fonts\nare newer versions of fonts installed by Creative Suite 4. If the installer finds older versions of these\nfonts in the default system font directory, it will uninstall the older versions, and save them to a new\ndirectory. The default system font directory is:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Fonts\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Windows\\Fonts\n\nThe older fonts will be saved in the new directory:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Application Support/Adobe/SavedFonts/current\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\SavedFonts\\current\n\nThis new directory will also contain a file named "Read Me.html" which lists the saved fonts, as\nwell as the version numbers of the new and old font files.\n\nYou can re-install the older fonts by deleting the new font files from the default system font\ndirectory and moving the old files back into that directory.\n\nThere are additional fonts on the installation disc. For information on installing these fonts, see\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fontinstall_en.\n\nKnown issues\nPlease refer to Adobe Support for late-breaking information and known issues for all Creative Suite\n5 applications.\n\n64-bit issues\n\nOn Macintosh only, several plug-ins are no longer supported for 64-bit systems. These plug-ins will\nonly run in 32-bit mode:\n\n   •   Embed/Read Watermark\n   •   Lighting Effects\n   •   Send Video Preview to Device\n   •   Variations\n   •   Video Preview\n   •   Optional plug-ins (Contact Sheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI, Web Photo Gallery).\n       NOTE: These plug-ins are not included in your Photoshop CS5 install. You can find more\n       info at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain the\n       plug-ins along with the Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fYou may encounter instabilities with some third-party Carbon plug-ins from CS4 or earlier. We\ntherefore recommend that you do not copy third-party plug-ins directly to the Photoshop Plug-ins\nfolder. Third-party plug-ins should be stored in a separate folder and then loaded via Preferences >\nPlug-ins > Additional Plug-ins. If instabilities occur in the app, either through general use or when\nusing a plug-in directly, follow the plug-in troubleshooting guidelines\nat go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb409112_en-us to resolve the issue.\n\nExtract plug-in\n\nThe Extract plug-in is no longer supported in Photoshop CS5. We highly recommend you use\nRefine Edge and the Quick Select Tool for optimal selections.\n\nGB18030 support for Windows XP\n\nIn order to support the display of all characters of the Chinese standard GB18030 on Windows XP\nsystems, Adobe recommends the installation of the Microsoft GB18030 Support Package. This\nsupport package will update an XP system with, among other things, fonts and input-method-editors\n(IMEs) to correctly support GB18030. The support package is available as a download from the\nMicrosoft website.\n\nGPU and video card support\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 includes support for graphics card acceleration by using the graphics card's\n       Graphics Processing Unit. On Windows XP, or if you are using an unsupported card,\n       OpenGL is turned off by default. This means that features that rely on GPU support will not\n       be available. For a list of features relying on this support, refer to the GPU guidance\n       at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n   •   The Nvidia 7300GT will not work properly with OpenGL on Macintosh systems prior to\n       10.6. We advise you to upgrade to 10.6 if you would like to enable OpenGL functionality.\n\nHow-To links (Help > How To...)\n\nAll How-To links have been removed from Photoshop CS5.\n\nJPEG 2000\n\nThis plug-in is now included in the Photoshop CS5 default install. You no longer need to install it\n(from Photoshop CS4) as an optional plug-in.\n\nOptional plug-ins not installed in Photoshop CS5 and downloadable online\n\n   •   PDF Presentation and Web Photo Gallery can be found in Bridge CS5 in the Adobe Output\n       Model (AOM). If you want to download the Photoshop CS5 versions of PDF Presentation\n       and Web Photo Gallery, please see the following document for\n       information: go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain\n       the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fNOTE: The Web Photo Gallery plug-in does not work in Photoshop Mac 64-bit; you must launch\nPhotoshop in 32-bit mode to use this legacy plug-in on the Mac.\n\n   •   ContactSheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI and Picture Package are also not installed in\n       Photoshop CS5 along with the Textures and Layouts presets. If you want to download these\n       plug-ins, you can find them at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download\n       package will contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\nNOTE: ContactSheet, PatternMaker and Photomerge plug-ins do not work on Photoshop Mac 64-\nbit; you must launch Photoshop in 32-bit mode to use these legacy plug-ins on the Mac.\n\nFor more information on support and download locations, go to\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_mac_en or\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_win_en.\n\nOther Optional plug-ins:\n\n   •   Firewire and FirewireDLL are supported only on 32-bit systems for Mac & Win.\n   •   TWAIN for 32-bit Macintosh and Windows systems (see below for more information)\n\nPlug-ins, extensions and filters not installed in Photoshop CS5 (normally found in\nGoodies folder in versions prior to Photoshop CS4)\n\n   •   Bigger Tiles has been removed from Photoshop CS5 as the functionality has now been built\n       into the performance preferences. This can now be set in the UI by setting "Cache Tile Size"\n       to 1024K or 1028K in the performance section of Photoshop preferences.\n   •   Filmstrip format (plug-in) for 32-bit/64-bit Macintosh and Windows systems has been\n       removed from the install. In addition, it is no longer available to download.\n\nSave for Web\n\n   •   If you try to save named slices to a directory where that filename already exists, Photoshop\n       will fail to prompt you with an overwrite warning. You will silently overwrite the existing\n       file.\n   •   We have removed the shortcut used to delete the preference file for Save for Web in\n       Photoshop CS5. To manually delete this preference file, navigate to the following locations\n       and delete the Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Preferences file:\n       Windows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Application Data\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Windows Vista or Windows 7: C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Macintosh: Volume\\username\\Library\\Preferences\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n\nTool Presets\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 can read tool presets created by earlier versions of Photoshop, but earlier\n       versions of Photoshop cannot read tool presets created by Photoshop CS5.\n\n                                                 8\n\fType\n\n  •    If you are using the NVIDIA GeForce 7300GT, you may experience performance issues\n       when editing text, especially on large documents. We recommend that you upgrade your\n       video card for a better experience. For more information on this card and support options,\n       please refer to the GPU guidance document located at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n       This card is extremely problematic for many areas in Photoshop and we suggest you contact\n       the manufacturer for more information if needed.\n  •    The Japanese text input mode Koteoeri/ATOK is not supported on Mac OS 10.5.x and\n       earlier. You may experience slowdowns and lack of response when attempting to use this\n       input method. Please contact Apple support if you would like more information on this. We\n       recommend that you upgrade to Mac OS 10.6 to resolve this issue.\n  •    The legacy shortcut to duplicate and transform (Cmd + Opt + T) on Mac 10.5 now opens the\n       Character panel.\n\nTWAIN support\n\n  •    Photoshop does not install the TWAIN plug-in for Photoshop CS5. For information on\n       TWAIN support and download, refer to go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us or contact\n       the manufacturer of your device for further TWAIN support. The download package will\n       contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me for Photoshop CS5. Do not use\n       the TWAIN plug-in from Photoshop CS4 downloads.\n  •    64-bit Support: 64-bit TWAIN scanners are not officially supported in either 64-bit or 32-bit\n       Photoshop. Use at your own risk. However we have found that the Canon PIXMA MP990\n       (64-bit) works well on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Mac OS 10.6. If you need to use a\n       TWAIN scanner, we recommend that you use this scanner and upgrade to Mac OS 10.6.\n\nPHOTOSHOP CS5 EXTENDED KNOWN ISSUES\n\n3D General\n\n  •    The Nvidia GeForce 7300GT is a problematic card, especially for 3D in Photoshop on\n       Macintosh OS < 10.6. You may experience frequent crashes as well as limited functionality.\n       We recommend that you upgrade your Macintosh systems to 10.6 for a better experience.\n  •    Adobe Repoussé is dependant on OpenGL; you must have a OpenGL supported card. See\n       go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_83117_en-us for a list of supported cards and troubleshooting\n       tips.\n  •    3D objects imported (OBJ and KMZ) with missing textures may need to have their Opacity\n       manually changed to 100%. Many applications will export objects with Opacity set to 0%\n       and therefore Photoshop reads this material as fully transparent.\n  •    When creating holes using Adobe Repoussé from type layers, you may experience missing\n       geometry on the front face of the mesh if the font size is too small relative to the hole.\n  •    Image Based Lights do not have a specular component; gloss and shine maps will not have\n       any effect.\n\nCollada DAE/KMZ file format\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fDAE/KMZ mesh/model pieces may show up in the wrong place. This is because we do not create\nmeshes for polygon types like Lines and Points. In addition, because the mesh hierarchy is not\naccurate, transformations may not be in the right place. Unfortunately, as we do not support lines\nand points in our renderer, we currently have no way to resolve this issue.\n\nGoogle Warehouse 3D files (Collada) from Sketch-up 7.1\n\nGoogle Sketchup 7.1 changed the way they export their Collada format. If you have a Google 3D\nCollada file (DAE/KMZ) where it opens with missing meshes or textures, the file needs to be re-\nexported from Sketchup 7.1 or later with the Export parameter "Preserve Component hierarchies"\nunchecked.\n\nPoser 3D Collada files\n\nModels exported from Poser will often come into Photoshop with Opacity of textures set to 0%. To\nview these textures, simply change Opacity to 100% for all textures.\n\nCustomer care\nCustomer Service\n\nAdobe Customer Service provides assistance with product information, sales, registration, and other\nnon-technical issues.

If you are installing as an upgrade, the installer will check your system to find a valid\n      upgrade product. If it cannot find one, it will ask you to input the serial number of the\n      product being upgraded. You can also install the software as a trial, then input your new and\n      previous serial numbers in the serialization screen shown during launch.\n   5. For additional CS5 installation help, go to www.adobe.com/go/cs5install/.\n\nAdobe Photoshop CS5 and Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended\n\nBoth Adobe Photoshop CS5 and Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended have the option to run natively in\neither 32-bit or 64-bit editions of Windows® Vista® Home Premium, Business, Ultimate, or\nEnterprise with Service Pack 2, Windows® 7 or Macintosh OSX v10.5.7 - 10.6.2.\n\nMacintosh 64-bit\n\nPhotoshop will automatically detect and run the 64-bit version on 64-bit Macintosh systems. To\nforce Photoshop to launch the 32-bit version, navigate to the application and "Get Info" (Control +\nClick on the application icon), then select the "Open in 32-bit mode" checkbox.\n\nMicrosoft® Vista® or Windows 7\n\nPhotoshop will automatically install the 32-bit version of Photoshop CS5 if you are on a 32-bit\nWindows OS. Photoshop will install both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Photoshop on 64-bit\nsystems. To install only the Photoshop 64-bit version on a 64-bit Windows OS, follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n   1. Run the Photoshop CS5 installer.\n   2. Enter your serial number. Click Accept.\n   3. On the right side of the Options panel under the 64-bit heading, uncheck the box for Adobe\n      Photoshop CS5.

The\n       application will be installed in the correct location: C:\\Program Files (x86).\n   •   The "Total Size" displayed in the Installer Options screen includes space required for\n       components required for the installation but NOT shown in the component list; the number\n       may not equal the listed components size.\n   •   For more detailed information about troubleshooting your installation, go\n       to www.adobe.com/go/support_loganalyzer.\n\nNote: In order to install additional components or reinstall your software after your original\ninstallation, you will need access to the original installer (CD, DVD or the download from the\nweb). Repair is not an available option.\n\n   •   If you are running Microsoft® Windows® XP with Service Pack 3, Photoshop will run in\n       both 32-bit and 64-bit editions. However, we do not officially support the 64-bit edition and\n       you may run into problems.\n   •   If you install Photoshop CS5 on your system and then install Photoshop CS4 afterward, you\n       will not in the future be able to use the Photoshop CS4 installer to repair your Photoshop\n       CS4 installation. To do the repair, you must uninstall Photoshop CS4 and then reinstall it.\n\nUninstall your software\nBefore you uninstall, close all applications currently running on your system (including other Adobe\napplications, Microsoft Office applications, and browser windows).\n\nDo one of the following:\n\n   •   In Windows® XP, open the Windows Control Panel and double-click Add or Remove\n       Programs. Select the product that you want to uninstall, click Change/Remove, then follow\n       the on-screen instructions.\n   •   In Windows® Vista® and Windows® 7, open the Windows Control Panel and double-click\n       Programs and Features. Select the product that you want to uninstall, click Uninstall, then\n       follow the on-screen instructions.\n   •   IMPORTANT: Mac OS has new uninstall functionality. DO NOT drag applications to the\n       trash to uninstall them. To safely uninstall on Mac OS X, double-click the product installer\n       in Applications/Utilities/Adobe Installers or double-click on the Uninstall alias located in the\n       Application folder. Select Remove Preferences, then Authenticate as an Administrator and\n       follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nNote: We allow you to install on two computers per serial number. If you have done so, but want to\ninstall the product on a new machine, you must first deactivate the software on one of your\ncomputers. To deactivate, either choose Help > Deactivate or check the Deactivate checkbox during\nthe uninstall process.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fTrial software\nEntering a serial number\n\nEnter the serial number for the software you purchased in the serialization screen. The serialization\nscreen will load the first time you launch the application. You can enter a serial number for the\napplication itself or a serial number for any Creative Suite that contains the application. If the\nproduct you purchased is one of the Creative Suites, you can enter the serial number in any of the\napplications contained in the Creative Suite. Other applications installed as part of the same Creative\nSuite will recognize the new serial number the next time the applications are launched.\n\nOnly applications running as a trial will recognize the new serial number. If any of the applications\nhave already been serialized with a different serial number, they will continue to use that serial\nnumber until you remove the older serial number using Help > Deactivate > Deactivate\nPermanently. After selecting this option, they will recognize the new serial number on the next\nlaunch of the application.\n\nThe serial number you purchased is for the use of the software in a specific language, and will only\nbe accepted by a product installed in that language.\n\nVolume licensing\n\nVolume licensing customers cannot purchase from a trial directly. However, a volume licensing\nserial number can be used to serialize all Creative Suite applications, except the Acrobat 9 trial or\nretail versions that ship with Creative Suite. Photoshop CS5 volume licensing software must be\npurchased from an authorized Adobe licensing center. Please contact your reseller or authorized\nAdobe licensing center to place an order for a volume license. To find a reseller in your area, go to\nhttp://partners.adobe.com/resellerfinder/na/reseller.jsp.\n\nElectronic licensing\nYou must accept the license agreement and warranty terms to use this product.\nSee www.adobe.com/go/eulas for details. This product may automatically attempt to activate over\nthe Internet. See www.adobe.com/go/activation for details.\n\nRegistration information\nCreating an Adobe ID registers your software and sets up access to Adobe CS Live online services.\nIn order to take advantage of your complimentary subscription of CS Live services, and get up-to-\ndate product information, training, newsletters, and invitations to Adobe events and seminars, you\nmust register your product.\n\nFont installation\nAll font related documentation is online. Visit\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/creativesuite/creativesuite5.html to find our OpenType\n                                                5\n\fUser Guide, OpenType Read Me, links to font-specific Read Me documents, listings of fonts\ninstalled by the different CS5 products, and listings of fonts included on DVD for each of the CS5\nproducts.\n\nThe Creative Suite 5 installer installs fonts into a default system font directory. Many of these fonts\nare newer versions of fonts installed by Creative Suite 4. If the installer finds older versions of these\nfonts in the default system font directory, it will uninstall the older versions, and save them to a new\ndirectory. The default system font directory is:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Fonts\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Windows\\Fonts\n\nThe older fonts will be saved in the new directory:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Application Support/Adobe/SavedFonts/current\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\SavedFonts\\current\n\nThis new directory will also contain a file named "Read Me.html" which lists the saved fonts, as\nwell as the version numbers of the new and old font files.\n\nYou can re-install the older fonts by deleting the new font files from the default system font\ndirectory and moving the old files back into that directory.\n\nThere are additional fonts on the installation disc. For information on installing these fonts, see\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fontinstall_en.\n\nKnown issues\nPlease refer to Adobe Support for late-breaking information and known issues for all Creative Suite\n5 applications.\n\n64-bit issues\n\nOn Macintosh only, several plug-ins are no longer supported for 64-bit systems. These plug-ins will\nonly run in 32-bit mode:\n\n   •   Embed/Read Watermark\n   •   Lighting Effects\n   •   Send Video Preview to Device\n   •   Variations\n   •   Video Preview\n   •   Optional plug-ins (Contact Sheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI, Web Photo Gallery).\n       NOTE: These plug-ins are not included in your Photoshop CS5 install. You can find more\n       info at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain the\n       plug-ins along with the Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fYou may encounter instabilities with some third-party Carbon plug-ins from CS4 or earlier. We\ntherefore recommend that you do not copy third-party plug-ins directly to the Photoshop Plug-ins\nfolder. Third-party plug-ins should be stored in a separate folder and then loaded via Preferences >\nPlug-ins > Additional Plug-ins. If instabilities occur in the app, either through general use or when\nusing a plug-in directly, follow the plug-in troubleshooting guidelines\nat go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb409112_en-us to resolve the issue.\n\nExtract plug-in\n\nThe Extract plug-in is no longer supported in Photoshop CS5. We highly recommend you use\nRefine Edge and the Quick Select Tool for optimal selections.\n\nGB18030 support for Windows XP\n\nIn order to support the display of all characters of the Chinese standard GB18030 on Windows XP\nsystems, Adobe recommends the installation of the Microsoft GB18030 Support Package. This\nsupport package will update an XP system with, among other things, fonts and input-method-editors\n(IMEs) to correctly support GB18030. The support package is available as a download from the\nMicrosoft website.\n\nGPU and video card support\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 includes support for graphics card acceleration by using the graphics card's\n       Graphics Processing Unit. On Windows XP, or if you are using an unsupported card,\n       OpenGL is turned off by default. This means that features that rely on GPU support will not\n       be available. For a list of features relying on this support, refer to the GPU guidance\n       at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n   •   The Nvidia 7300GT will not work properly with OpenGL on Macintosh systems prior to\n       10.6. We advise you to upgrade to 10.6 if you would like to enable OpenGL functionality.\n\nHow-To links (Help > How To...)\n\nAll How-To links have been removed from Photoshop CS5.\n\nJPEG 2000\n\nThis plug-in is now included in the Photoshop CS5 default install. You no longer need to install it\n(from Photoshop CS4) as an optional plug-in.\n\nOptional plug-ins not installed in Photoshop CS5 and downloadable online\n\n   •   PDF Presentation and Web Photo Gallery can be found in Bridge CS5 in the Adobe Output\n       Model (AOM). If you want to download the Photoshop CS5 versions of PDF Presentation\n       and Web Photo Gallery, please see the following document for\n       information: go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain\n       the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fNOTE: The Web Photo Gallery plug-in does not work in Photoshop Mac 64-bit; you must launch\nPhotoshop in 32-bit mode to use this legacy plug-in on the Mac.\n\n   •   ContactSheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI and Picture Package are also not installed in\n       Photoshop CS5 along with the Textures and Layouts presets. If you want to download these\n       plug-ins, you can find them at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download\n       package will contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\nNOTE: ContactSheet, PatternMaker and Photomerge plug-ins do not work on Photoshop Mac 64-\nbit; you must launch Photoshop in 32-bit mode to use these legacy plug-ins on the Mac.\n\nFor more information on support and download locations, go to\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_mac_en or\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_win_en.\n\nOther Optional plug-ins:\n\n   •   Firewire and FirewireDLL are supported only on 32-bit systems for Mac & Win.\n   •   TWAIN for 32-bit Macintosh and Windows systems (see below for more information)\n\nPlug-ins, extensions and filters not installed in Photoshop CS5 (normally found in\nGoodies folder in versions prior to Photoshop CS4)\n\n   •   Bigger Tiles has been removed from Photoshop CS5 as the functionality has now been built\n       into the performance preferences. This can now be set in the UI by setting "Cache Tile Size"\n       to 1024K or 1028K in the performance section of Photoshop preferences.\n   •   Filmstrip format (plug-in) for 32-bit/64-bit Macintosh and Windows systems has been\n       removed from the install. In addition, it is no longer available to download.\n\nSave for Web\n\n   •   If you try to save named slices to a directory where that filename already exists, Photoshop\n       will fail to prompt you with an overwrite warning. You will silently overwrite the existing\n       file.\n   •   We have removed the shortcut used to delete the preference file for Save for Web in\n       Photoshop CS5. To manually delete this preference file, navigate to the following locations\n       and delete the Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Preferences file:\n       Windows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Application Data\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Windows Vista or Windows 7: C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Macintosh: Volume\\username\\Library\\Preferences\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n\nTool Presets\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 can read tool presets created by earlier versions of Photoshop, but earlier\n       versions of Photoshop cannot read tool presets created by Photoshop CS5.\n\n                                                 8\n\fType\n\n  •    If you are using the NVIDIA GeForce 7300GT, you may experience performance issues\n       when editing text, especially on large documents. We recommend that you upgrade your\n       video card for a better experience. For more information on this card and support options,\n       please refer to the GPU guidance document located at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n       This card is extremely problematic for many areas in Photoshop and we suggest you contact\n       the manufacturer for more information if needed.\n  •    The Japanese text input mode Koteoeri/ATOK is not supported on Mac OS 10.5.x and\n       earlier. You may experience slowdowns and lack of response when attempting to use this\n       input method. Please contact Apple support if you would like more information on this. We\n       recommend that you upgrade to Mac OS 10.6 to resolve this issue.\n  •    The legacy shortcut to duplicate and transform (Cmd + Opt + T) on Mac 10.5 now opens the\n       Character panel.\n\nTWAIN support\n\n  •    Photoshop does not install the TWAIN plug-in for Photoshop CS5. For information on\n       TWAIN support and download, refer to go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us or contact\n       the manufacturer of your device for further TWAIN support. The download package will\n       contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me for Photoshop CS5. Do not use\n       the TWAIN plug-in from Photoshop CS4 downloads.\n  •    64-bit Support: 64-bit TWAIN scanners are not officially supported in either 64-bit or 32-bit\n       Photoshop. Use at your own risk. However we have found that the Canon PIXMA MP990\n       (64-bit) works well on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Mac OS 10.6. If you need to use a\n       TWAIN scanner, we recommend that you use this scanner and upgrade to Mac OS 10.6.\n\nPHOTOSHOP CS5 EXTENDED KNOWN ISSUES\n\n3D General\n\n  •    The Nvidia GeForce 7300GT is a problematic card, especially for 3D in Photoshop on\n       Macintosh OS < 10.6. You may experience frequent crashes as well as limited functionality.\n       We recommend that you upgrade your Macintosh systems to 10.6 for a better experience.\n  •    Adobe Repoussé is dependant on OpenGL; you must have a OpenGL supported card. See\n       go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_83117_en-us for a list of supported cards and troubleshooting\n       tips.\n  •    3D objects imported (OBJ and KMZ) with missing textures may need to have their Opacity\n       manually changed to 100%. Many applications will export objects with Opacity set to 0%\n       and therefore Photoshop reads this material as fully transparent.\n  •    When creating holes using Adobe Repoussé from type layers, you may experience missing\n       geometry on the front face of the mesh if the font size is too small relative to the hole.\n  •    Image Based Lights do not have a specular component; gloss and shine maps will not have\n       any effect.\n\nCollada DAE/KMZ file format\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fDAE/KMZ mesh/model pieces may show up in the wrong place. This is because we do not create\nmeshes for polygon types like Lines and Points. In addition, because the mesh hierarchy is not\naccurate, transformations may not be in the right place. Unfortunately, as we do not support lines\nand points in our renderer, we currently have no way to resolve this issue.\n\nGoogle Warehouse 3D files (Collada) from Sketch-up 7.1\n\nGoogle Sketchup 7.1 changed the way they export their Collada format. If you have a Google 3D\nCollada file (DAE/KMZ) where it opens with missing meshes or textures, the file needs to be re-\nexported from Sketchup 7.1 or later with the Export parameter "Preserve Component hierarchies"\nunchecked.\n\nPoser 3D Collada files\n\nModels exported from Poser will often come into Photoshop with Opacity of textures set to 0%. To\nview these textures, simply change Opacity to 100% for all textures.\n\nCustomer care\nCustomer Service\n\nAdobe Customer Service provides assistance with product information, sales, registration, and other\nnon-technical issues.

                             5\n\f1         Introduction\n          This User’s Guide describes how to use the Intel® Management and Security Status\n          application. The application’s component tabs—detailed in this document—display\n          information about a platform’s support for the following technologies: Intel® Active\n          Management Technology (Intel® AMT), Intel® Small Business Technology (Intel® SBT),\n          Intel® Standard Manageability and Intel® Anti-Theft Technology (Intel® AT). All of\n          these technologies are built upon the Intel® Management Engine (Intel® ME), a\n          feature provided within the platform hardware.\n\n          The Intel® Management and Security Status icon indicates whether Intel® Active\n          Management Technology, Intel® Small Business Technology, Intel® Standard\n          Manageability and Intel® Anti-Theft Technology are running on the platform. The icon\n          is located in the notification area. By default, each time Windows* starts, Intel®\n          Management and Security Status application starts and the notification icon is\n          displayed.\n\n          The Intel® Management and Security Status application has a separate version per\n          every Intel® AMT generation (6.x, 7.x, 8.x, 9.x etc.). The installer for 9.x also\n          supports the 8.x generation. If the Intel® Management and Security Status application\n          starts automatically as a result of the user logging on to Windows*, the icon will be\n          loaded to the notification area only if a supported combination of the following\n          technologies is present on the platform: Intel® Active Management Technology, Intel®\n          Small Business Technology, and Intel® Standard Manageability. If the Intel®\n          Management and Security Status application is started manually (via the Start menu),\n          the icon is loaded even if none of these technologies are enabled.\n\n    Note: The information displayed in the Intel® Management and Security Status application is\n          not shown in real time.

The\nstatus can be one of the following:\n   Intel® AMT: Enabled / Disabled / Information unavailable\n       When Intel® AMT status presents Enabled it means that the Intel® AMT is\n    supported on the system. Intel® ME status (in the Advanced Tab) will give the\n    user information on whether the Intel® ME is configured (hence Intel® AMT is\n    functional and operating).\n       When Intel® AMT status presents Disabled it means that the Intel® AMT is\n    either not enabled on the system or has been disabled by the IT administrator.\n        Information unavailable: It is not known whether Intel® AMT is supported on\n    the system. No Intel® AMT information is available. This can be for one of the\n    following reasons: LMS service has stopped, or the Intel® Management Engine\n    Interface (Intel® MEI) driver is disabled.\n   Intel® SBT: Enabled / Disabled / Information unavailable\n       When Intel® SBT status presents Enabled it means that the Intel® SBT is\n    supported on the system. Intel® ME status (in the Advanced Tab) will give the\n    user information on whether the Intel® ME is configured (hence Intel® SBT is\n    functional and operating).\n       When Intel® SBT status presents Disabled it means that the Intel® SBT is\n    either not enabled on the system or has been disabled by the IT administrator.\n        Information unavailable: It is not known whether Intel® SBT is supported on\n    the system. No Intel® SBT information is available. This can be for one of the\n    following reasons: LMS service has stopped, or the Intel MEI driver is disabled.\n   Intel® Standard Manageability: Enabled / Disabled / Information unavailable\n       When Intel® Standard Manageability status presents Enabled it means that\n    the Intel® Standard Manageability technology is supported on the system. Intel®\n    ME status (in the Advanced Tab) will give the user information on whether the\n    Intel® ME is configured (hence Intel® Standard Manageability is functional and\n    operating).\n       When Intel® Standard Manageability status presents Disabled it means that\n    the Intel® Standard Manageability technology is either not enabled on the system\n    or has been disabled by the IT administrator.\n\n\n\n\n             10\n\f              Information unavailable: It is not known whether Intel® Standard\n           Manageability technology is supported on the system. No Intel® Standard\n           Manageability information is available. This can be for one of the following\n           reasons: LMS service has stopped, or the Intel MEI driver is disabled.\n          Intel® Anti-Theft Technology: Enabled. This means that the Intel® Anti-Theft\n           Technology feature is supported on the platform. If Intel® Anti-Theft Technology is\n           not supported on the platform; no reference to it is displayed. The feature\n           becomes activated only after the platform has been enrolled with an Intel® Anti-\n           Theft Technology service provider and all required configurations have been\n           applied.\n\nNote: The information in this field shows the state of the platform at the last platform boot.\n\n       Enable user notification: Checking this box allows the user to enable or disable the\n       Intel® Management and Security Status icon from displaying important notifications in\n       the notification area (for instance, notification will be sent when one of the\n       technologies is enabled or disabled). Checking or unchecking the checkbox affects the\n       Intel® Management and Security Status application setting for the current user\n       account only.\n\n       On Windows* 8 platforms, IMSS user notifications are also displayed as Windows* 8\n       UI ‘Toast’ notifications, visible to users working with the Windows* 8 UI. These\n       notifications will only be displayed as long as a Windows* 8 UI Start Menu shortcut\n       (Windows* 8 UI ‘tile’) is present.\n\n       Intel® Management and Security Status application will be available next\n       time I log on to Windows*: Checking this box causes the Intel® Management and\n       Security Status application to be invoked, and the icon to be displayed, whenever you\n       log on to Windows*. Checking or unchecking the checkbox affects Intel® Management\n       and Security Status application’s behavior for the current user account only.\n\nNote: The application does not load automatically with Windows* log-on if none of the\n      technologies it displays (Intel® Active Management Technology, Intel® Small Business\n      Technology or Intel® Standard Manageability) are supported on the platform. Intel®\n      Management and Security Status application will load automatically even if all of the\n      technologies are disabled, so long as they are supported. Intel ® Management and\n      Security Status application will not load if these technologies are not supported in the\n      platform.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             11\n\f3.2          Intel® Active Management Technology Tab\n      Note: This tab is displayed only if the platform supports Intel® AMT.\n\n             Click the Intel® AMT tab to display Intel® AMT information.\n\n\n\n\n Figure 3-2.\n\n\n\n\n                          12\n\f3.2.1     Fast Call for Help\n          The Fast Call for Help section provides Client Initiated Local Access (CILA) or Client\n          Initiated Remote Access (CIRA) capabilities depending on whether the system is\n          connected to the corporate network or not, respectively. The Fast Call for Help section\n          will be available for the CIRA/CILA use-cases, providing the proper configuration for\n          CIRA/CILA has been done, as well as for a case in which the user’s system did not\n          receive an IP address while the wireless network is available for a support session to\n          take place. Otherwise, the Fast Call for Help section will be grayed out.\n\n          CIRA allows a user to connect the Intel® AMT system to the company’s Information\n          Technology network from an external internet connection. Click the “Get Technical\n          Help” button to connect to your Information Technology network for system\n          diagnostics and maintenance.

Such settings are typically done by management software.\n          (Configuration details appear in the Intel® AMT SDK Implementation and Reference\n          Guide).\n\n    Note: The information displayed in the Intel® Management and Security Status application,\n          including the Fast Call for Help section, is not shown in real time. The data is\n          refreshed every time an event has arrived.\n\n    Note: When the user is connected as Guest account (in Windows*) the “Fast Call For Help”\n          section will be grayed out. This was designed to prevent users outside of the\n          organization to influence the organization network.\n\n\n3.2.2     Support Session Status\n          The following information is provided:\n              KVM Remote Control Connection\n\n              Indicates whether KVM (Keyboard, Video & Mouse) Remote Control session is open.\n              Possible values: Connected/ Disconnected/ Information unavailable.\n              The “KVM Remote Control Connection” section will be grayed out if the KVM Remote\n              Control feature is disabled on the system.\n              Media Redirection\n\n              Indicates whether there are any open IDE redirection sessions.\n              Possible values: Connected/ Disconnected/ Information unavailable.\n              Terminal and Keyboard Redirection\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 13\n\f          Indicates whether there are any open terminal/keyboard redirection sessions.\n          Possible values: Connected/ Disconnected/ Information unavailable.\n\n\n\n          Stop Sessions\n\n          Click the “Stop Sessions” button to close any open KVM Remote Control, media\n          redirection, or terminal/keyboard redirection sessions. In cases when user consent\n          is required for such a session, re-establishing the session will require renewal of\n          user consent after clicking this button.\n          Hot Key\n\n          Indicates the hot key which could be used to close any open KVM Remote Control,\n          media redirection, or terminal/keyboard redirection sessions (same effect as “Stop\n          Sessions” button).\n\n          Click on the “Change” button to choose a different hot key for terminating an open\n          session.\n          Prevent Access\n\n          This button will appear in cases where user consent is required for a remote support\n          session to occur. In such cases, after the user will provide the required approval to\n          the remote administrator and as long as the healing session hasn’t begun, the user\n          will see the “Prevent Access” button. This button enables the user to change his/her\n          mind, as clicking on it will cancel user consent and disable the ability of the IT\n          administrator to begin the remote session. During this time, the Hot Key will also\n          serve as a means to cancel user consent. Once a remote support session has\n          begun, the “Prevent Access” button will no longer be visible, and the “Stop\n          Sessions” button will appear instead.\n\n\n\n\nNote: User Consent, when required, will be granted to the administrator per session, by the\n      user giving the administrator a one-time pass code which will appear on the Secure\n      Output Window presented on the user’s screen.

The Restore Connection button enables the user to return\n            control of the wireless network to the OS. However, if this button is clicked while\n            the remote support session is still active, the session will be terminated.\n\n            This button is not shown on platforms from Intel ME 8.1 onwards.\n\n\n\n3.6.4   Network Information\n        Click the “Network Information” button to display network details regarding Intel® ME\n        wireless and wired connectivity.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               23\n\fFigure 3-8.\n\n\n\n\n         In the Connection Type section, click either Wireless Connection or Wired\n         Connection to display information on the following items for the selected interface:\n              Link Status\n\n              Whether the link is currently active.\n              Possible values are: Link up/Link down/Information unavailable\n              MAC Information\n\n              XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX – e.g. 88:88:88:0A:88:87\n\n\n\n\n                        24\n\f              IPv4 Address\n\n              XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX – e.g. 208.77.188.166\n              IPv4 Mode\n\n              Possible values: Static/ DHCP/ Information unavailable.\n              IPv6 address\n\n              If IPv6 addressing is enabled for the Intel ME, the Intel® Management and Security\n              Status application displays up to 6 IPv6 IP addresses configured for an Intel ME\n              network interface for wired connection, and up to 5 IPv6 IP addresses for wireless\n              connection.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3-9.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               25\n\f        Data which appears only for Wireless Connection\n\n\n            Configured for Wireless\n\n            Possible values are: Wireless enabled/ Wireless disabled/ Information unavailable.\n            WLAN control\n\n            On Intel ME 8.0 systems only, the WLAN control indicates whether the wireless\n            network is available to the user’s computer operating system (i.e. regular usage) or\n            whether it is in control of the Intel® Management Engine for the purpose of remote\n            support by an IT administrator. Possible values are: HOST / Intel® ME. This control\n            is not shown on platforms from Intel ME 8.1 onwards.\n            WLAN preference\n\n            On Intel ME 8.0 systems only, WLAN preference indicates whether the wireless\n            network should preferably be in control of the operating system or the Intel®\n            Management Engine (Intel® ME). Expected behavior is for WLAN control to be the\n            same as WLAN preference. However, if for some reason the operating system fails\n            to take control over the wireless network (e.g. the wireless driver is dysfunctional),\n            the user will witness WLAN preference given to the operating system while WLAN\n            control is with Intel® ME (even if the Return Control button was clicked).\n            Possible values are: Operating System/ Intel® ME. This control is not shown on\n            platforms from Intel ME 8.1 onwards.\n\n\n3.6.5   Extended System Details\n        When clicking Extended System Details, a Windows* System Information window will\n        open, providing an extensive report about system components and configuration.\n\n        The report includes both general information regarding the system (“Host\n        Information”) and specific Intel® Management Engine Information (“Intel® ME\n        Information”).\n\n        It is possible to save the system report to a file by clicking File->Export on the System\n        Information Window.\n\n        Below are explanations for some of the details displayed under Intel® ME Information:\n\n        Host information:\n            Operating System Name – The Windows* operating system that the application is\n             running on.\n            Operating System Version – The version of the operating system.\n            System Manufacturer – The hardware manufacturer.\n            System Name – The computer name as recognized by the operating system.\n            System Model – The hardware platform name.\n            Processor – The processor full brand name.\n\n\n                       26\n\f   BIOS Version – The BIOS manufacturer name and BIOS version number.\n   LAN Driver – The version number of the LAN device driver.\n   LAN DeviceID – The PCI Device ID for the LAN device.\n   WLAN Driver - The version number of the Wireless LAN device driver.\n   WLAN DeviceID – The PCI Device ID for the Wireless LAN device.\n\n\n\nIntel® ME Information:\n   Intel ME Control Mode – The configuration mode (Client Control or Admin Control).\n   Provisioning Mode – State of Intel ME configuration (Pre/In/Post).\n   BIOS boot – The BIOS boot state (expected to be Post Boot).\n   Last Intel ME reset reason - The reason that the Intel® ME was last reset (Global\n    System/ FW reset / Power Up/ Unknown cause/ Information unavailable).\n   System UUID – The Universal Unique Identifier of the computer.

If the installer does not launch automatically, open the folder, navigate to the\n       Adobe CS5 folder, double-click Set-up.exe, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n       Mac:\n       Insert the DVD in your drive, navigate to the Adobe Photoshop CS5 folder found at the root\n       level on the DVD, double-click Install.app, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n       If you downloaded the software from the web, open the folder, navigate to the application\n       folder, double-click Install.app, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n   4. If you are installing as an upgrade, the installer will check your system to find a valid\n      upgrade product. If it cannot find one, it will ask you to input the serial number of the\n      product being upgraded. You can also install the software as a trial, then input your new and\n      previous serial numbers in the serialization screen shown during launch.\n   5. For additional CS5 installation help, go to www.adobe.com/go/cs5install/.\n\nAdobe Photoshop CS5 and Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended\n\nBoth Adobe Photoshop CS5 and Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended have the option to run natively in\neither 32-bit or 64-bit editions of Windows® Vista® Home Premium, Business, Ultimate, or\nEnterprise with Service Pack 2, Windows® 7 or Macintosh OSX v10.5.7 - 10.6.2.\n\nMacintosh 64-bit\n\nPhotoshop will automatically detect and run the 64-bit version on 64-bit Macintosh systems. To\nforce Photoshop to launch the 32-bit version, navigate to the application and "Get Info" (Control +\nClick on the application icon), then select the "Open in 32-bit mode" checkbox.\n\nMicrosoft® Vista® or Windows 7\n\nPhotoshop will automatically install the 32-bit version of Photoshop CS5 if you are on a 32-bit\nWindows OS. Photoshop will install both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Photoshop on 64-bit\nsystems. To install only the Photoshop 64-bit version on a 64-bit Windows OS, follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n   1. Run the Photoshop CS5 installer.\n   2. Enter your serial number. Click Accept.\n   3. On the right side of the Options panel under the 64-bit heading, uncheck the box for Adobe\n      Photoshop CS5. Leave the "Adobe Photoshop CS5 (64-bit)" option checked.\n   4. Finish installation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fKnown issues\n\n   •   On Mac, you cannot install to the root directory of the boot drive.\n   •   When installing on Vista64, an incorrect default installation location appears. The\n       application will be installed in the correct location: C:\\Program Files (x86).\n   •   The "Total Size" displayed in the Installer Options screen includes space required for\n       components required for the installation but NOT shown in the component list; the number\n       may not equal the listed components size.\n   •   For more detailed information about troubleshooting your installation, go\n       to www.adobe.com/go/support_loganalyzer.\n\nNote: In order to install additional components or reinstall your software after your original\ninstallation, you will need access to the original installer (CD, DVD or the download from the\nweb). Repair is not an available option.\n\n   •   If you are running Microsoft® Windows® XP with Service Pack 3, Photoshop will run in\n       both 32-bit and 64-bit editions. However, we do not officially support the 64-bit edition and\n       you may run into problems.\n   •   If you install Photoshop CS5 on your system and then install Photoshop CS4 afterward, you\n       will not in the future be able to use the Photoshop CS4 installer to repair your Photoshop\n       CS4 installation. To do the repair, you must uninstall Photoshop CS4 and then reinstall it.\n\nUninstall your software\nBefore you uninstall, close all applications currently running on your system (including other Adobe\napplications, Microsoft Office applications, and browser windows).\n\nDo one of the following:\n\n   •   In Windows® XP, open the Windows Control Panel and double-click Add or Remove\n       Programs. Select the product that you want to uninstall, click Change/Remove, then follow\n       the on-screen instructions.\n   •   In Windows® Vista® and Windows® 7, open the Windows Control Panel and double-click\n       Programs and Features. Select the product that you want to uninstall, click Uninstall, then\n       follow the on-screen instructions.\n   •   IMPORTANT: Mac OS has new uninstall functionality. DO NOT drag applications to the\n       trash to uninstall them. To safely uninstall on Mac OS X, double-click the product installer\n       in Applications/Utilities/Adobe Installers or double-click on the Uninstall alias located in the\n       Application folder. Select Remove Preferences, then Authenticate as an Administrator and\n       follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nNote: We allow you to install on two computers per serial number. If you have done so, but want to\ninstall the product on a new machine, you must first deactivate the software on one of your\ncomputers. To deactivate, either choose Help > Deactivate or check the Deactivate checkbox during\nthe uninstall process.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fTrial software\nEntering a serial number\n\nEnter the serial number for the software you purchased in the serialization screen. The serialization\nscreen will load the first time you launch the application. You can enter a serial number for the\napplication itself or a serial number for any Creative Suite that contains the application. If the\nproduct you purchased is one of the Creative Suites, you can enter the serial number in any of the\napplications contained in the Creative Suite. Other applications installed as part of the same Creative\nSuite will recognize the new serial number the next time the applications are launched.\n\nOnly applications running as a trial will recognize the new serial number. If any of the applications\nhave already been serialized with a different serial number, they will continue to use that serial\nnumber until you remove the older serial number using Help > Deactivate > Deactivate\nPermanently. After selecting this option, they will recognize the new serial number on the next\nlaunch of the application.\n\nThe serial number you purchased is for the use of the software in a specific language, and will only\nbe accepted by a product installed in that language.\n\nVolume licensing\n\nVolume licensing customers cannot purchase from a trial directly. However, a volume licensing\nserial number can be used to serialize all Creative Suite applications, except the Acrobat 9 trial or\nretail versions that ship with Creative Suite. Photoshop CS5 volume licensing software must be\npurchased from an authorized Adobe licensing center. Please contact your reseller or authorized\nAdobe licensing center to place an order for a volume license. To find a reseller in your area, go to\nhttp://partners.adobe.com/resellerfinder/na/reseller.jsp.\n\nElectronic licensing\nYou must accept the license agreement and warranty terms to use this product.\nSee www.adobe.com/go/eulas for details. This product may automatically attempt to activate over\nthe Internet. See www.adobe.com/go/activation for details.\n\nRegistration information\nCreating an Adobe ID registers your software and sets up access to Adobe CS Live online services.\nIn order to take advantage of your complimentary subscription of CS Live services, and get up-to-\ndate product information, training, newsletters, and invitations to Adobe events and seminars, you\nmust register your product.\n\nFont installation\nAll font related documentation is online. Visit\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/creativesuite/creativesuite5.html to find our OpenType\n                                                5\n\fUser Guide, OpenType Read Me, links to font-specific Read Me documents, listings of fonts\ninstalled by the different CS5 products, and listings of fonts included on DVD for each of the CS5\nproducts.\n\nThe Creative Suite 5 installer installs fonts into a default system font directory. Many of these fonts\nare newer versions of fonts installed by Creative Suite 4. If the installer finds older versions of these\nfonts in the default system font directory, it will uninstall the older versions, and save them to a new\ndirectory. The default system font directory is:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Fonts\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Windows\\Fonts\n\nThe older fonts will be saved in the new directory:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Application Support/Adobe/SavedFonts/current\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\SavedFonts\\current\n\nThis new directory will also contain a file named "Read Me.html" which lists the saved fonts, as\nwell as the version numbers of the new and old font files.\n\nYou can re-install the older fonts by deleting the new font files from the default system font\ndirectory and moving the old files back into that directory.\n\nThere are additional fonts on the installation disc. For information on installing these fonts, see\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fontinstall_en.\n\nKnown issues\nPlease refer to Adobe Support for late-breaking information and known issues for all Creative Suite\n5 applications.\n\n64-bit issues\n\nOn Macintosh only, several plug-ins are no longer supported for 64-bit systems. These plug-ins will\nonly run in 32-bit mode:\n\n   •   Embed/Read Watermark\n   •   Lighting Effects\n   •   Send Video Preview to Device\n   •   Variations\n   •   Video Preview\n   •   Optional plug-ins (Contact Sheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI, Web Photo Gallery).\n       NOTE: These plug-ins are not included in your Photoshop CS5 install. You can find more\n       info at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain the\n       plug-ins along with the Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fYou may encounter instabilities with some third-party Carbon plug-ins from CS4 or earlier. We\ntherefore recommend that you do not copy third-party plug-ins directly to the Photoshop Plug-ins\nfolder. Third-party plug-ins should be stored in a separate folder and then loaded via Preferences >\nPlug-ins > Additional Plug-ins. If instabilities occur in the app, either through general use or when\nusing a plug-in directly, follow the plug-in troubleshooting guidelines\nat go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb409112_en-us to resolve the issue.\n\nExtract plug-in\n\nThe Extract plug-in is no longer supported in Photoshop CS5. We highly recommend you use\nRefine Edge and the Quick Select Tool for optimal selections.\n\nGB18030 support for Windows XP\n\nIn order to support the display of all characters of the Chinese standard GB18030 on Windows XP\nsystems, Adobe recommends the installation of the Microsoft GB18030 Support Package. This\nsupport package will update an XP system with, among other things, fonts and input-method-editors\n(IMEs) to correctly support GB18030. The support package is available as a download from the\nMicrosoft website.\n\nGPU and video card support\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 includes support for graphics card acceleration by using the graphics card's\n       Graphics Processing Unit. On Windows XP, or if you are using an unsupported card,\n       OpenGL is turned off by default. This means that features that rely on GPU support will not\n       be available. For a list of features relying on this support, refer to the GPU guidance\n       at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n   •   The Nvidia 7300GT will not work properly with OpenGL on Macintosh systems prior to\n       10.6. We advise you to upgrade to 10.6 if you would like to enable OpenGL functionality.\n\nHow-To links (Help > How To...)\n\nAll How-To links have been removed from Photoshop CS5.\n\nJPEG 2000\n\nThis plug-in is now included in the Photoshop CS5 default install. You no longer need to install it\n(from Photoshop CS4) as an optional plug-in.\n\nOptional plug-ins not installed in Photoshop CS5 and downloadable online\n\n   •   PDF Presentation and Web Photo Gallery can be found in Bridge CS5 in the Adobe Output\n       Model (AOM). If you want to download the Photoshop CS5 versions of PDF Presentation\n       and Web Photo Gallery, please see the following document for\n       information: go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain\n       the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fNOTE: The Web Photo Gallery plug-in does not work in Photoshop Mac 64-bit; you must launch\nPhotoshop in 32-bit mode to use this legacy plug-in on the Mac.\n\n   •   ContactSheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI and Picture Package are also not installed in\n       Photoshop CS5 along with the Textures and Layouts presets. If you want to download these\n       plug-ins, you can find them at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download\n       package will contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\nNOTE: ContactSheet, PatternMaker and Photomerge plug-ins do not work on Photoshop Mac 64-\nbit; you must launch Photoshop in 32-bit mode to use these legacy plug-ins on the Mac.\n\nFor more information on support and download locations, go to\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_mac_en or\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_win_en.\n\nOther Optional plug-ins:\n\n   •   Firewire and FirewireDLL are supported only on 32-bit systems for Mac & Win.\n   •   TWAIN for 32-bit Macintosh and Windows systems (see below for more information)\n\nPlug-ins, extensions and filters not installed in Photoshop CS5 (normally found in\nGoodies folder in versions prior to Photoshop CS4)\n\n   •   Bigger Tiles has been removed from Photoshop CS5 as the functionality has now been built\n       into the performance preferences. This can now be set in the UI by setting "Cache Tile Size"\n       to 1024K or 1028K in the performance section of Photoshop preferences.\n   •   Filmstrip format (plug-in) for 32-bit/64-bit Macintosh and Windows systems has been\n       removed from the install. In addition, it is no longer available to download.\n\nSave for Web\n\n   •   If you try to save named slices to a directory where that filename already exists, Photoshop\n       will fail to prompt you with an overwrite warning. You will silently overwrite the existing\n       file.\n   •   We have removed the shortcut used to delete the preference file for Save for Web in\n       Photoshop CS5. To manually delete this preference file, navigate to the following locations\n       and delete the Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Preferences file:\n       Windows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Application Data\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Windows Vista or Windows 7: C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Macintosh: Volume\\username\\Library\\Preferences\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n\nTool Presets\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 can read tool presets created by earlier versions of Photoshop, but earlier\n       versions of Photoshop cannot read tool presets created by Photoshop CS5.\n\n                                                 8\n\fType\n\n  •    If you are using the NVIDIA GeForce 7300GT, you may experience performance issues\n       when editing text, especially on large documents. We recommend that you upgrade your\n       video card for a better experience. For more information on this card and support options,\n       please refer to the GPU guidance document located at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n       This card is extremely problematic for many areas in Photoshop and we suggest you contact\n       the manufacturer for more information if needed.\n  •    The Japanese text input mode Koteoeri/ATOK is not supported on Mac OS 10.5.x and\n       earlier. You may experience slowdowns and lack of response when attempting to use this\n       input method. Please contact Apple support if you would like more information on this. We\n       recommend that you upgrade to Mac OS 10.6 to resolve this issue.\n  •    The legacy shortcut to duplicate and transform (Cmd + Opt + T) on Mac 10.5 now opens the\n       Character panel.\n\nTWAIN support\n\n  •    Photoshop does not install the TWAIN plug-in for Photoshop CS5. For information on\n       TWAIN support and download, refer to go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us or contact\n       the manufacturer of your device for further TWAIN support. The download package will\n       contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me for Photoshop CS5. Do not use\n       the TWAIN plug-in from Photoshop CS4 downloads.\n  •    64-bit Support: 64-bit TWAIN scanners are not officially supported in either 64-bit or 32-bit\n       Photoshop. Use at your own risk. However we have found that the Canon PIXMA MP990\n       (64-bit) works well on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Mac OS 10.6. If you need to use a\n       TWAIN scanner, we recommend that you use this scanner and upgrade to Mac OS 10.6.\n\nPHOTOSHOP CS5 EXTENDED KNOWN ISSUES\n\n3D General\n\n  •    The Nvidia GeForce 7300GT is a problematic card, especially for 3D in Photoshop on\n       Macintosh OS < 10.6. You may experience frequent crashes as well as limited functionality.\n       We recommend that you upgrade your Macintosh systems to 10.6 for a better experience.\n  •    Adobe Repoussé is dependant on OpenGL; you must have a OpenGL supported card. See\n       go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_83117_en-us for a list of supported cards and troubleshooting\n       tips.\n  •    3D objects imported (OBJ and KMZ) with missing textures may need to have their Opacity\n       manually changed to 100%. Many applications will export objects with Opacity set to 0%\n       and therefore Photoshop reads this material as fully transparent.\n  •    When creating holes using Adobe Repoussé from type layers, you may experience missing\n       geometry on the front face of the mesh if the font size is too small relative to the hole.\n  •    Image Based Lights do not have a specular component; gloss and shine maps will not have\n       any effect.\n\nCollada DAE/KMZ file format\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fDAE/KMZ mesh/model pieces may show up in the wrong place. This is because we do not create\nmeshes for polygon types like Lines and Points. In addition, because the mesh hierarchy is not\naccurate, transformations may not be in the right place. Unfortunately, as we do not support lines\nand points in our renderer, we currently have no way to resolve this issue.\n\nGoogle Warehouse 3D files (Collada) from Sketch-up 7.1\n\nGoogle Sketchup 7.1 changed the way they export their Collada format. If you have a Google 3D\nCollada file (DAE/KMZ) where it opens with missing meshes or textures, the file needs to be re-\nexported from Sketchup 7.1 or later with the Export parameter "Preserve Component hierarchies"\nunchecked.\n\nPoser 3D Collada files\n\nModels exported from Poser will often come into Photoshop with Opacity of textures set to 0%. To\nview these textures, simply change Opacity to 100% for all textures.\n\nCustomer care\nCustomer Service\n\nAdobe Customer Service provides assistance with product information, sales, registration, and other\nnon-technical issues.

The Online Services, and\nsome features thereof, may not be available in all countries, languages, and/or currencies and may\nbe discontinued or modified in whole or in part without notice. Use of the Online Services is\ngoverned by separate terms of use and by the Online Privacy Policy, and access to some services\nmay require user registration.

For more details and to review the applicable terms of use and\nOnline Privacy Policy, visit www.adobe.com.\n\nInstall your software\n   1. Before you install, be sure to close all applications currently running on your system\n      (including other Adobe applications, Microsoft Office applications, and browser\n      windows). We also recommend that you temporarily turn off virus protection during the\n      installation process.\n   2. You must have administrative privileges or be able to validate as an administrator.\n   3. Do one of the following:\n\n\n                                                  2\n\f       Windows:\n       Insert the DVD in your drive, then follow the on-screen instructions. If the installer does not\n       launch automatically, navigate to the Adobe Photoshop CS5 folder found at the root level on\n       the DVD and double-click Set-up.exe to start the installation process.\n       If you downloaded the software from the web, the installer will self-extract and launch\n       automatically. If the installer does not launch automatically, open the folder, navigate to the\n       Adobe CS5 folder, double-click Set-up.exe, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n       Mac:\n       Insert the DVD in your drive, navigate to the Adobe Photoshop CS5 folder found at the root\n       level on the DVD, double-click Install.app, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n       If you downloaded the software from the web, open the folder, navigate to the application\n       folder, double-click Install.app, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n   4. If you are installing as an upgrade, the installer will check your system to find a valid\n      upgrade product. If it cannot find one, it will ask you to input the serial number of the\n      product being upgraded. You can also install the software as a trial, then input your new and\n      previous serial numbers in the serialization screen shown during launch.\n   5. For additional CS5 installation help, go to www.adobe.com/go/cs5install/.\n\nAdobe Photoshop CS5 and Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended\n\nBoth Adobe Photoshop CS5 and Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended have the option to run natively in\neither 32-bit or 64-bit editions of Windows® Vista® Home Premium, Business, Ultimate, or\nEnterprise with Service Pack 2, Windows® 7 or Macintosh OSX v10.5.7 - 10.6.2.\n\nMacintosh 64-bit\n\nPhotoshop will automatically detect and run the 64-bit version on 64-bit Macintosh systems. To\nforce Photoshop to launch the 32-bit version, navigate to the application and "Get Info" (Control +\nClick on the application icon), then select the "Open in 32-bit mode" checkbox.\n\nMicrosoft® Vista® or Windows 7\n\nPhotoshop will automatically install the 32-bit version of Photoshop CS5 if you are on a 32-bit\nWindows OS. Photoshop will install both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Photoshop on 64-bit\nsystems. To install only the Photoshop 64-bit version on a 64-bit Windows OS, follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n   1. Run the Photoshop CS5 installer.\n   2. Enter your serial number. Click Accept.\n   3. On the right side of the Options panel under the 64-bit heading, uncheck the box for Adobe\n      Photoshop CS5. Leave the "Adobe Photoshop CS5 (64-bit)" option checked.\n   4. Finish installation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fKnown issues\n\n   •   On Mac, you cannot install to the root directory of the boot drive.\n   •   When installing on Vista64, an incorrect default installation location appears. The\n       application will be installed in the correct location: C:\\Program Files (x86).\n   •   The "Total Size" displayed in the Installer Options screen includes space required for\n       components required for the installation but NOT shown in the component list; the number\n       may not equal the listed components size.\n   •   For more detailed information about troubleshooting your installation, go\n       to www.adobe.com/go/support_loganalyzer.\n\nNote: In order to install additional components or reinstall your software after your original\ninstallation, you will need access to the original installer (CD, DVD or the download from the\nweb). Repair is not an available option.\n\n   •   If you are running Microsoft® Windows® XP with Service Pack 3, Photoshop will run in\n       both 32-bit and 64-bit editions. However, we do not officially support the 64-bit edition and\n       you may run into problems.\n   •   If you install Photoshop CS5 on your system and then install Photoshop CS4 afterward, you\n       will not in the future be able to use the Photoshop CS4 installer to repair your Photoshop\n       CS4 installation. To do the repair, you must uninstall Photoshop CS4 and then reinstall it.\n\nUninstall your software\nBefore you uninstall, close all applications currently running on your system (including other Adobe\napplications, Microsoft Office applications, and browser windows).\n\nDo one of the following:\n\n   •   In Windows® XP, open the Windows Control Panel and double-click Add or Remove\n       Programs. Select the product that you want to uninstall, click Change/Remove, then follow\n       the on-screen instructions.\n   •   In Windows® Vista® and Windows® 7, open the Windows Control Panel and double-click\n       Programs and Features. Select the product that you want to uninstall, click Uninstall, then\n       follow the on-screen instructions.\n   •   IMPORTANT: Mac OS has new uninstall functionality. DO NOT drag applications to the\n       trash to uninstall them. To safely uninstall on Mac OS X, double-click the product installer\n       in Applications/Utilities/Adobe Installers or double-click on the Uninstall alias located in the\n       Application folder. Select Remove Preferences, then Authenticate as an Administrator and\n       follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nNote: We allow you to install on two computers per serial number. If you have done so, but want to\ninstall the product on a new machine, you must first deactivate the software on one of your\ncomputers. To deactivate, either choose Help > Deactivate or check the Deactivate checkbox during\nthe uninstall process.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fTrial software\nEntering a serial number\n\nEnter the serial number for the software you purchased in the serialization screen. The serialization\nscreen will load the first time you launch the application. You can enter a serial number for the\napplication itself or a serial number for any Creative Suite that contains the application. If the\nproduct you purchased is one of the Creative Suites, you can enter the serial number in any of the\napplications contained in the Creative Suite. Other applications installed as part of the same Creative\nSuite will recognize the new serial number the next time the applications are launched.\n\nOnly applications running as a trial will recognize the new serial number. If any of the applications\nhave already been serialized with a different serial number, they will continue to use that serial\nnumber until you remove the older serial number using Help > Deactivate > Deactivate\nPermanently. After selecting this option, they will recognize the new serial number on the next\nlaunch of the application.\n\nThe serial number you purchased is for the use of the software in a specific language, and will only\nbe accepted by a product installed in that language.\n\nVolume licensing\n\nVolume licensing customers cannot purchase from a trial directly. However, a volume licensing\nserial number can be used to serialize all Creative Suite applications, except the Acrobat 9 trial or\nretail versions that ship with Creative Suite. Photoshop CS5 volume licensing software must be\npurchased from an authorized Adobe licensing center. Please contact your reseller or authorized\nAdobe licensing center to place an order for a volume license. To find a reseller in your area, go to\nhttp://partners.adobe.com/resellerfinder/na/reseller.jsp.\n\nElectronic licensing\nYou must accept the license agreement and warranty terms to use this product.\nSee www.adobe.com/go/eulas for details. This product may automatically attempt to activate over\nthe Internet. See www.adobe.com/go/activation for details.\n\nRegistration information\nCreating an Adobe ID registers your software and sets up access to Adobe CS Live online services.\nIn order to take advantage of your complimentary subscription of CS Live services, and get up-to-\ndate product information, training, newsletters, and invitations to Adobe events and seminars, you\nmust register your product.\n\nFont installation\nAll font related documentation is online. Visit\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/creativesuite/creativesuite5.html to find our OpenType\n                                                5\n\fUser Guide, OpenType Read Me, links to font-specific Read Me documents, listings of fonts\ninstalled by the different CS5 products, and listings of fonts included on DVD for each of the CS5\nproducts.\n\nThe Creative Suite 5 installer installs fonts into a default system font directory. Many of these fonts\nare newer versions of fonts installed by Creative Suite 4. If the installer finds older versions of these\nfonts in the default system font directory, it will uninstall the older versions, and save them to a new\ndirectory. The default system font directory is:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Fonts\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Windows\\Fonts\n\nThe older fonts will be saved in the new directory:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Application Support/Adobe/SavedFonts/current\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\SavedFonts\\current\n\nThis new directory will also contain a file named "Read Me.html" which lists the saved fonts, as\nwell as the version numbers of the new and old font files.\n\nYou can re-install the older fonts by deleting the new font files from the default system font\ndirectory and moving the old files back into that directory.\n\nThere are additional fonts on the installation disc. For information on installing these fonts, see\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fontinstall_en.\n\nKnown issues\nPlease refer to Adobe Support for late-breaking information and known issues for all Creative Suite\n5 applications.\n\n64-bit issues\n\nOn Macintosh only, several plug-ins are no longer supported for 64-bit systems. These plug-ins will\nonly run in 32-bit mode:\n\n   •   Embed/Read Watermark\n   •   Lighting Effects\n   •   Send Video Preview to Device\n   •   Variations\n   •   Video Preview\n   •   Optional plug-ins (Contact Sheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI, Web Photo Gallery).\n       NOTE: These plug-ins are not included in your Photoshop CS5 install. You can find more\n       info at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain the\n       plug-ins along with the Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fYou may encounter instabilities with some third-party Carbon plug-ins from CS4 or earlier. We\ntherefore recommend that you do not copy third-party plug-ins directly to the Photoshop Plug-ins\nfolder. Third-party plug-ins should be stored in a separate folder and then loaded via Preferences >\nPlug-ins > Additional Plug-ins. If instabilities occur in the app, either through general use or when\nusing a plug-in directly, follow the plug-in troubleshooting guidelines\nat go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb409112_en-us to resolve the issue.\n\nExtract plug-in\n\nThe Extract plug-in is no longer supported in Photoshop CS5. We highly recommend you use\nRefine Edge and the Quick Select Tool for optimal selections.\n\nGB18030 support for Windows XP\n\nIn order to support the display of all characters of the Chinese standard GB18030 on Windows XP\nsystems, Adobe recommends the installation of the Microsoft GB18030 Support Package. This\nsupport package will update an XP system with, among other things, fonts and input-method-editors\n(IMEs) to correctly support GB18030. The support package is available as a download from the\nMicrosoft website.\n\nGPU and video card support\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 includes support for graphics card acceleration by using the graphics card's\n       Graphics Processing Unit. On Windows XP, or if you are using an unsupported card,\n       OpenGL is turned off by default. This means that features that rely on GPU support will not\n       be available. For a list of features relying on this support, refer to the GPU guidance\n       at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n   •   The Nvidia 7300GT will not work properly with OpenGL on Macintosh systems prior to\n       10.6. We advise you to upgrade to 10.6 if you would like to enable OpenGL functionality.\n\nHow-To links (Help > How To...)\n\nAll How-To links have been removed from Photoshop CS5.\n\nJPEG 2000\n\nThis plug-in is now included in the Photoshop CS5 default install. You no longer need to install it\n(from Photoshop CS4) as an optional plug-in.\n\nOptional plug-ins not installed in Photoshop CS5 and downloadable online\n\n   •   PDF Presentation and Web Photo Gallery can be found in Bridge CS5 in the Adobe Output\n       Model (AOM). If you want to download the Photoshop CS5 versions of PDF Presentation\n       and Web Photo Gallery, please see the following document for\n       information: go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain\n       the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fNOTE: The Web Photo Gallery plug-in does not work in Photoshop Mac 64-bit; you must launch\nPhotoshop in 32-bit mode to use this legacy plug-in on the Mac.\n\n   •   ContactSheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI and Picture Package are also not installed in\n       Photoshop CS5 along with the Textures and Layouts presets. If you want to download these\n       plug-ins, you can find them at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download\n       package will contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\nNOTE: ContactSheet, PatternMaker and Photomerge plug-ins do not work on Photoshop Mac 64-\nbit; you must launch Photoshop in 32-bit mode to use these legacy plug-ins on the Mac.\n\nFor more information on support and download locations, go to\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_mac_en or\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_win_en.\n\nOther Optional plug-ins:\n\n   •   Firewire and FirewireDLL are supported only on 32-bit systems for Mac & Win.\n   •   TWAIN for 32-bit Macintosh and Windows systems (see below for more information)\n\nPlug-ins, extensions and filters not installed in Photoshop CS5 (normally found in\nGoodies folder in versions prior to Photoshop CS4)\n\n   •   Bigger Tiles has been removed from Photoshop CS5 as the functionality has now been built\n       into the performance preferences. This can now be set in the UI by setting "Cache Tile Size"\n       to 1024K or 1028K in the performance section of Photoshop preferences.\n   •   Filmstrip format (plug-in) for 32-bit/64-bit Macintosh and Windows systems has been\n       removed from the install. In addition, it is no longer available to download.\n\nSave for Web\n\n   •   If you try to save named slices to a directory where that filename already exists, Photoshop\n       will fail to prompt you with an overwrite warning. You will silently overwrite the existing\n       file.\n   •   We have removed the shortcut used to delete the preference file for Save for Web in\n       Photoshop CS5. To manually delete this preference file, navigate to the following locations\n       and delete the Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Preferences file:\n       Windows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Application Data\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Windows Vista or Windows 7: C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Macintosh: Volume\\username\\Library\\Preferences\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n\nTool Presets\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 can read tool presets created by earlier versions of Photoshop, but earlier\n       versions of Photoshop cannot read tool presets created by Photoshop CS5.\n\n                                                 8\n\fType\n\n  •    If you are using the NVIDIA GeForce 7300GT, you may experience performance issues\n       when editing text, especially on large documents. We recommend that you upgrade your\n       video card for a better experience. For more information on this card and support options,\n       please refer to the GPU guidance document located at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n       This card is extremely problematic for many areas in Photoshop and we suggest you contact\n       the manufacturer for more information if needed.\n  •    The Japanese text input mode Koteoeri/ATOK is not supported on Mac OS 10.5.x and\n       earlier. You may experience slowdowns and lack of response when attempting to use this\n       input method. Please contact Apple support if you would like more information on this. We\n       recommend that you upgrade to Mac OS 10.6 to resolve this issue.\n  •    The legacy shortcut to duplicate and transform (Cmd + Opt + T) on Mac 10.5 now opens the\n       Character panel.\n\nTWAIN support\n\n  •    Photoshop does not install the TWAIN plug-in for Photoshop CS5. For information on\n       TWAIN support and download, refer to go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us or contact\n       the manufacturer of your device for further TWAIN support. The download package will\n       contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me for Photoshop CS5. Do not use\n       the TWAIN plug-in from Photoshop CS4 downloads.\n  •    64-bit Support: 64-bit TWAIN scanners are not officially supported in either 64-bit or 32-bit\n       Photoshop. Use at your own risk. However we have found that the Canon PIXMA MP990\n       (64-bit) works well on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Mac OS 10.6. If you need to use a\n       TWAIN scanner, we recommend that you use this scanner and upgrade to Mac OS 10.6.\n\nPHOTOSHOP CS5 EXTENDED KNOWN ISSUES\n\n3D General\n\n  •    The Nvidia GeForce 7300GT is a problematic card, especially for 3D in Photoshop on\n       Macintosh OS < 10.6. You may experience frequent crashes as well as limited functionality.\n       We recommend that you upgrade your Macintosh systems to 10.6 for a better experience.\n  •    Adobe Repoussé is dependant on OpenGL; you must have a OpenGL supported card. See\n       go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_83117_en-us for a list of supported cards and troubleshooting\n       tips.\n  •    3D objects imported (OBJ and KMZ) with missing textures may need to have their Opacity\n       manually changed to 100%. Many applications will export objects with Opacity set to 0%\n       and therefore Photoshop reads this material as fully transparent.\n  •    When creating holes using Adobe Repoussé from type layers, you may experience missing\n       geometry on the front face of the mesh if the font size is too small relative to the hole.\n  •    Image Based Lights do not have a specular component; gloss and shine maps will not have\n       any effect.\n\nCollada DAE/KMZ file format\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fDAE/KMZ mesh/model pieces may show up in the wrong place. This is because we do not create\nmeshes for polygon types like Lines and Points. In addition, because the mesh hierarchy is not\naccurate, transformations may not be in the right place. Unfortunately, as we do not support lines\nand points in our renderer, we currently have no way to resolve this issue.\n\nGoogle Warehouse 3D files (Collada) from Sketch-up 7.1\n\nGoogle Sketchup 7.1 changed the way they export their Collada format. If you have a Google 3D\nCollada file (DAE/KMZ) where it opens with missing meshes or textures, the file needs to be re-\nexported from Sketchup 7.1 or later with the Export parameter "Preserve Component hierarchies"\nunchecked.\n\nPoser 3D Collada files\n\nModels exported from Poser will often come into Photoshop with Opacity of textures set to 0%. To\nview these textures, simply change Opacity to 100% for all textures.\n\nCustomer care\nCustomer Service\n\nAdobe Customer Service provides assistance with product information, sales, registration, and other\nnon-technical issues.

The\n       application will be installed in the correct location: C:\\Program Files (x86).\n   •   The "Total Size" displayed in the Installer Options screen includes space required for\n       components required for the installation but NOT shown in the component list; the number\n       may not equal the listed components size.\n   •   For more detailed information about troubleshooting your installation, go\n       to www.adobe.com/go/support_loganalyzer.\n\nNote: In order to install additional components or reinstall your software after your original\ninstallation, you will need access to the original installer (CD, DVD or the download from the\nweb). Repair is not an available option.\n\n   •   If you are running Microsoft® Windows® XP with Service Pack 3, Photoshop will run in\n       both 32-bit and 64-bit editions. However, we do not officially support the 64-bit edition and\n       you may run into problems.\n   •   If you install Photoshop CS5 on your system and then install Photoshop CS4 afterward, you\n       will not in the future be able to use the Photoshop CS4 installer to repair your Photoshop\n       CS4 installation. To do the repair, you must uninstall Photoshop CS4 and then reinstall it.\n\nUninstall your software\nBefore you uninstall, close all applications currently running on your system (including other Adobe\napplications, Microsoft Office applications, and browser windows).\n\nDo one of the following:\n\n   •   In Windows® XP, open the Windows Control Panel and double-click Add or Remove\n       Programs.

Select the product that you want to uninstall, click Uninstall, then\n       follow the on-screen instructions.\n   •   IMPORTANT: Mac OS has new uninstall functionality. DO NOT drag applications to the\n       trash to uninstall them. To safely uninstall on Mac OS X, double-click the product installer\n       in Applications/Utilities/Adobe Installers or double-click on the Uninstall alias located in the\n       Application folder. Select Remove Preferences, then Authenticate as an Administrator and\n       follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nNote: We allow you to install on two computers per serial number. If you have done so, but want to\ninstall the product on a new machine, you must first deactivate the software on one of your\ncomputers. To deactivate, either choose Help > Deactivate or check the Deactivate checkbox during\nthe uninstall process.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fTrial software\nEntering a serial number\n\nEnter the serial number for the software you purchased in the serialization screen. The serialization\nscreen will load the first time you launch the application. You can enter a serial number for the\napplication itself or a serial number for any Creative Suite that contains the application. If the\nproduct you purchased is one of the Creative Suites, you can enter the serial number in any of the\napplications contained in the Creative Suite. Other applications installed as part of the same Creative\nSuite will recognize the new serial number the next time the applications are launched.\n\nOnly applications running as a trial will recognize the new serial number. If any of the applications\nhave already been serialized with a different serial number, they will continue to use that serial\nnumber until you remove the older serial number using Help > Deactivate > Deactivate\nPermanently. After selecting this option, they will recognize the new serial number on the next\nlaunch of the application.\n\nThe serial number you purchased is for the use of the software in a specific language, and will only\nbe accepted by a product installed in that language.\n\nVolume licensing\n\nVolume licensing customers cannot purchase from a trial directly. However, a volume licensing\nserial number can be used to serialize all Creative Suite applications, except the Acrobat 9 trial or\nretail versions that ship with Creative Suite. Photoshop CS5 volume licensing software must be\npurchased from an authorized Adobe licensing center. Please contact your reseller or authorized\nAdobe licensing center to place an order for a volume license.

Visit\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/creativesuite/creativesuite5.html to find our OpenType\n                                                5\n\fUser Guide, OpenType Read Me, links to font-specific Read Me documents, listings of fonts\ninstalled by the different CS5 products, and listings of fonts included on DVD for each of the CS5\nproducts.\n\nThe Creative Suite 5 installer installs fonts into a default system font directory. Many of these fonts\nare newer versions of fonts installed by Creative Suite 4. If the installer finds older versions of these\nfonts in the default system font directory, it will uninstall the older versions, and save them to a new\ndirectory. The default system font directory is:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Fonts\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Windows\\Fonts\n\nThe older fonts will be saved in the new directory:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Application Support/Adobe/SavedFonts/current\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\SavedFonts\\current\n\nThis new directory will also contain a file named "Read Me.html" which lists the saved fonts, as\nwell as the version numbers of the new and old font files.\n\nYou can re-install the older fonts by deleting the new font files from the default system font\ndirectory and moving the old files back into that directory.\n\nThere are additional fonts on the installation disc. For information on installing these fonts, see\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fontinstall_en.\n\nKnown issues\nPlease refer to Adobe Support for late-breaking information and known issues for all Creative Suite\n5 applications.\n\n64-bit issues\n\nOn Macintosh only, several plug-ins are no longer supported for 64-bit systems. These plug-ins will\nonly run in 32-bit mode:\n\n   •   Embed/Read Watermark\n   •   Lighting Effects\n   •   Send Video Preview to Device\n   •   Variations\n   •   Video Preview\n   •   Optional plug-ins (Contact Sheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI, Web Photo Gallery).\n       NOTE: These plug-ins are not included in your Photoshop CS5 install. You can find more\n       info at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain the\n       plug-ins along with the Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fYou may encounter instabilities with some third-party Carbon plug-ins from CS4 or earlier. We\ntherefore recommend that you do not copy third-party plug-ins directly to the Photoshop Plug-ins\nfolder. Third-party plug-ins should be stored in a separate folder and then loaded via Preferences >\nPlug-ins > Additional Plug-ins. If instabilities occur in the app, either through general use or when\nusing a plug-in directly, follow the plug-in troubleshooting guidelines\nat go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb409112_en-us to resolve the issue.\n\nExtract plug-in\n\nThe Extract plug-in is no longer supported in Photoshop CS5. We highly recommend you use\nRefine Edge and the Quick Select Tool for optimal selections.\n\nGB18030 support for Windows XP\n\nIn order to support the display of all characters of the Chinese standard GB18030 on Windows XP\nsystems, Adobe recommends the installation of the Microsoft GB18030 Support Package. This\nsupport package will update an XP system with, among other things, fonts and input-method-editors\n(IMEs) to correctly support GB18030. The support package is available as a download from the\nMicrosoft website.\n\nGPU and video card support\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 includes support for graphics card acceleration by using the graphics card's\n       Graphics Processing Unit. On Windows XP, or if you are using an unsupported card,\n       OpenGL is turned off by default. This means that features that rely on GPU support will not\n       be available. For a list of features relying on this support, refer to the GPU guidance\n       at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n   •   The Nvidia 7300GT will not work properly with OpenGL on Macintosh systems prior to\n       10.6. We advise you to upgrade to 10.6 if you would like to enable OpenGL functionality.\n\nHow-To links (Help > How To...)\n\nAll How-To links have been removed from Photoshop CS5.\n\nJPEG 2000\n\nThis plug-in is now included in the Photoshop CS5 default install. You no longer need to install it\n(from Photoshop CS4) as an optional plug-in.\n\nOptional plug-ins not installed in Photoshop CS5 and downloadable online\n\n   •   PDF Presentation and Web Photo Gallery can be found in Bridge CS5 in the Adobe Output\n       Model (AOM). If you want to download the Photoshop CS5 versions of PDF Presentation\n       and Web Photo Gallery, please see the following document for\n       information: go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain\n       the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fNOTE: The Web Photo Gallery plug-in does not work in Photoshop Mac 64-bit; you must launch\nPhotoshop in 32-bit mode to use this legacy plug-in on the Mac.\n\n   •   ContactSheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI and Picture Package are also not installed in\n       Photoshop CS5 along with the Textures and Layouts presets. If you want to download these\n       plug-ins, you can find them at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download\n       package will contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\nNOTE: ContactSheet, PatternMaker and Photomerge plug-ins do not work on Photoshop Mac 64-\nbit; you must launch Photoshop in 32-bit mode to use these legacy plug-ins on the Mac.\n\nFor more information on support and download locations, go to\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_mac_en or\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_win_en.\n\nOther Optional plug-ins:\n\n   •   Firewire and FirewireDLL are supported only on 32-bit systems for Mac & Win.\n   •   TWAIN for 32-bit Macintosh and Windows systems (see below for more information)\n\nPlug-ins, extensions and filters not installed in Photoshop CS5 (normally found in\nGoodies folder in versions prior to Photoshop CS4)\n\n   •   Bigger Tiles has been removed from Photoshop CS5 as the functionality has now been built\n       into the performance preferences. This can now be set in the UI by setting "Cache Tile Size"\n       to 1024K or 1028K in the performance section of Photoshop preferences.\n   •   Filmstrip format (plug-in) for 32-bit/64-bit Macintosh and Windows systems has been\n       removed from the install. In addition, it is no longer available to download.\n\nSave for Web\n\n   •   If you try to save named slices to a directory where that filename already exists, Photoshop\n       will fail to prompt you with an overwrite warning. You will silently overwrite the existing\n       file.\n   •   We have removed the shortcut used to delete the preference file for Save for Web in\n       Photoshop CS5. To manually delete this preference file, navigate to the following locations\n       and delete the Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Preferences file:\n       Windows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Application Data\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Windows Vista or Windows 7: C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Macintosh: Volume\\username\\Library\\Preferences\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n\nTool Presets\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 can read tool presets created by earlier versions of Photoshop, but earlier\n       versions of Photoshop cannot read tool presets created by Photoshop CS5.\n\n                                                 8\n\fType\n\n  •    If you are using the NVIDIA GeForce 7300GT, you may experience performance issues\n       when editing text, especially on large documents. We recommend that you upgrade your\n       video card for a better experience. For more information on this card and support options,\n       please refer to the GPU guidance document located at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n       This card is extremely problematic for many areas in Photoshop and we suggest you contact\n       the manufacturer for more information if needed.\n  •    The Japanese text input mode Koteoeri/ATOK is not supported on Mac OS 10.5.x and\n       earlier. You may experience slowdowns and lack of response when attempting to use this\n       input method. Please contact Apple support if you would like more information on this. We\n       recommend that you upgrade to Mac OS 10.6 to resolve this issue.\n  •    The legacy shortcut to duplicate and transform (Cmd + Opt + T) on Mac 10.5 now opens the\n       Character panel.\n\nTWAIN support\n\n  •    Photoshop does not install the TWAIN plug-in for Photoshop CS5. For information on\n       TWAIN support and download, refer to go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us or contact\n       the manufacturer of your device for further TWAIN support. The download package will\n       contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me for Photoshop CS5. Do not use\n       the TWAIN plug-in from Photoshop CS4 downloads.\n  •    64-bit Support: 64-bit TWAIN scanners are not officially supported in either 64-bit or 32-bit\n       Photoshop. Use at your own risk. However we have found that the Canon PIXMA MP990\n       (64-bit) works well on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Mac OS 10.6. If you need to use a\n       TWAIN scanner, we recommend that you use this scanner and upgrade to Mac OS 10.6.\n\nPHOTOSHOP CS5 EXTENDED KNOWN ISSUES\n\n3D General\n\n  •    The Nvidia GeForce 7300GT is a problematic card, especially for 3D in Photoshop on\n       Macintosh OS < 10.6. You may experience frequent crashes as well as limited functionality.\n       We recommend that you upgrade your Macintosh systems to 10.6 for a better experience.\n  •    Adobe Repoussé is dependant on OpenGL; you must have a OpenGL supported card. See\n       go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_83117_en-us for a list of supported cards and troubleshooting\n       tips.\n  •    3D objects imported (OBJ and KMZ) with missing textures may need to have their Opacity\n       manually changed to 100%. Many applications will export objects with Opacity set to 0%\n       and therefore Photoshop reads this material as fully transparent.\n  •    When creating holes using Adobe Repoussé from type layers, you may experience missing\n       geometry on the front face of the mesh if the font size is too small relative to the hole.\n  •    Image Based Lights do not have a specular component; gloss and shine maps will not have\n       any effect.\n\nCollada DAE/KMZ file format\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fDAE/KMZ mesh/model pieces may show up in the wrong place. This is because we do not create\nmeshes for polygon types like Lines and Points. In addition, because the mesh hierarchy is not\naccurate, transformations may not be in the right place. Unfortunately, as we do not support lines\nand points in our renderer, we currently have no way to resolve this issue.\n\nGoogle Warehouse 3D files (Collada) from Sketch-up 7.1\n\nGoogle Sketchup 7.1 changed the way they export their Collada format. If you have a Google 3D\nCollada file (DAE/KMZ) where it opens with missing meshes or textures, the file needs to be re-\nexported from Sketchup 7.1 or later with the Export parameter "Preserve Component hierarchies"\nunchecked.\n\nPoser 3D Collada files\n\nModels exported from Poser will often come into Photoshop with Opacity of textures set to 0%. To\nview these textures, simply change Opacity to 100% for all textures.\n\nCustomer care\nCustomer Service\n\nAdobe Customer Service provides assistance with product information, sales, registration, and other\nnon-technical issues.

There are specific operational challenges with transparency bills\n      a. Price transparency bills won’t do anything to help patients, increase access, or decrease the cost of\n          researching and bringing a drug to market.\n      b. Pharmaceutical RD doesn’t follow a linear path. Clinical teams may target research with the expectation that it may\n          impact rheumatoid arthritis, then may transition to other bone disease, and possibly on to other autoimmune diseases.\n          Research frequently moves in different directions. The end result could be the imposition of new rules that could\n          inhibit research.\n      c. There is no clear direction about how other outlays should be attributed (e.g., how would supplies, phone bills,\n          electric bills be attributed on a per product basis).\n\n\n3. Vertex’s invests a significant portion of its revenue on RD investment\n       a. From 2010-2014, Vertex spent 79 percent of revenue on R&D1\n       b. From 2005-2014 (i.e., over the last ten years), Vertex spent 106 percent of revenue on R&D2\n       c. Industry-wide average percentage of sales that went to R&D (2013): 17.9%3\n\n4. “Innovative” products receive minimal public funding4\n       a. 9 percent of all drugs approved between 1988 and 2005 had a public sector patent\n               i. Public sector patents: patents that were assigned to a government agency or had government interest\n                  statements (most of which came from academic laboratories that had received government funding)\n       b. 25 percent had a patent that cited at least one public-sector patent\n       c. 41 percent had a patent that cited at least one government publication\n       d. 48 percent had a patent that cited either a public-sector patent or a government publication\n\n5. Well over half of biomedical research is funded by private industry (based on 2010 analysis of 2007 JAMA)5\n      a. Industry: 58%\n      b. NIH: 27%\n      c. State/Local Government: 5%\n      d. Non-NIH Federal: 5%\n      e. Private Not-for profit: 4%\n\n6. The Federal government recognizes (CBO Report6) the value of the current biomedical research business model\n      a. “For U.S. taxpayers, the primary benefits of publicly funded research come from the therapeutic value of drugs that\n          ultimately result from that research and the Treasury’s receipt of corporate income taxes on profits from those\n          drugs. Constraining the prices of such drugs would tend to weaken firms’ incentives to develop government-funded\n          research discoveries into new drugs...”\n      b. “Most of the costs involved in developing a new drug come not from the initial discovery research but from clinical\n          testing and regulatory approval—costs that firms tend to bear themselves.”\n\n\n1\n  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Vertex\n    works with leading researchers, doctors, and other collaborators to help people with serious diseases, their families and\n    society. In addition to clinical development programs focused on cystic fibrosis (CF), Vertex has more than a dozen ongoing\n    research programs aimed at other serious and life-threatening diseases.1,2\n\n    Understanding of the science of cystic fibrosis (CF) is driving Vertex to discover and develop investigational medicines\n    that may treat the vast majority of people with CF in the coming years. While we have come a long way, there is more\n    work to be done—two out of three people with CF in the US do not yet have a medicine that treats the underlying\n    cause of their disease.2\n         •    Four Phase 3 studies of the investigational combination of VX-661 and ivacaftor are ongoing in different groups\n              of people with CF who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation.3\n         •    Two investigational next-generation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) correctors, VX-\n              152 and VX-440, are in clinical development. Vertex hopes these clinical studies will contribute to the\n              development of future combination regimens. This is an important part of our strategy to potentially provide\n              additional benefits to patients not helped by KALYDECO® (ivacaftor) or ORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) today.2,4\n         •    Vertex is collaborating with Parion Sciences to develop the investigational epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)\n              inhibitor VX-371 as a potential treatment for all people with CF regardless of CFTR mutation. Parion is currently\n              conducting an exploratory Phase 2a study of inhaled VX-371. Vertex plans to conduct a phase 2a study in the first\n              quarter of 2016 to evaluate VX-371 in patients who have two copies of the F508del mutation and are taking\n              ORKAMBI®. 2,5\n\n\n\n\n    In October 2015, Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics announced a strategic research collaboration to explore the use of the\n    gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to discover and develop potential new treatments to correct the\n    underlying genetic causes of human diseases. The initial focus of this collaborative research will be the genetic mutations\n    that cause CF and sickle cell disease. This collaboration continues the emphasis on innovative science which has been a\n    part of Vertex since its founding in 1989.6\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f    The Science of Possibility—Investigational Medicines in the Vertex Pipeline\n\n\n    Vertex has research and development programs focused on the treatment of key mechanisms that are\n    part of multiple serious diseases.2,7\n    Several investigational medicines are currently in clinical development for diseases other than CF.\n    These investigational compounds include:\n       • In addition to the ongoing and planned Phase 2 studies of VX-371 in CF, Vertex and Parion\n            plan to begin the first study of VX-371 in people with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in\n            the second half of 2016.2\n       • VX-970, VX-803 and VX-984 which are compounds designed to inhibit DNA repair pathways\n            fundamental to the survival and proliferation of certain cancers. These investigational\n            medicines were discovered by Vertex scientists and may be applicable to the treatment of\n            multiple tumor types. VX- 970 is the most advanced drug candidate in oncology with two on-\n            going clinical studies. VX-803 and VX-984 are in Phase 1 of clinical studies. 2,7\n       • VX-150 and VX-241 are two investigational medicines designed to inhibit sodium channels\n            involved in pain sensation. VX-150 is designed to block pain signaling through inhibition of a\n            sodium channel known as NaV 1.8. Vertex recently entered a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical\n            study in a small number of patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee.

48	Lead: Getting the Drug on Formulary	                                       Lead: Getting the Drug on Formulary\n\n         Background\n         Under federal law, Medicaid fee-for-service (“FFS”) formulary rules require states to provide\n         access to all medically necessary drugs from any manufacturer participating in the national\n         rebate program. Except for a limited list of drugs that states are not required to cover (such as\n         weight loss drugs), a state may only exclude a drug from formulary if it determines the drug\n         lacks a “clinically meaningful therapeutic advantage” and must provide the public with a written\n         explanation of the decision. When a state excludes a drug from formulary on this basis, it still\n         must be made available through a prior authorization (“PA”) program. When determining\n         whether or not to exclude a drug from formulary, legally a state may only take clinical – and not\n         cost – factors into consideration.\n\n         Federal law only defines reasons to exclude a drug from a formulary rather than reasons to\n         include a drug, and thus there is a strong argument that a drug must be included on formulary\n         unless and until the state determines to exclude it. However, federal law also does not explicitly\n         address the length of time a state may take to make an initial formulary determination, nor\n         does it explicitly require a drug be made available during the review period. A state’s Drug\n         Utilization Review Board (“DUR”) and Pharmacy and Therapeutics (“P&T”) Committee\n         responsible for deciding which drugs are covered on formulary may meet infrequently, which\n         could delay critical coverage decisions and hinder a patient’s access to a new, medically\n         necessary drug in a timely manner.\n\n         Medicaid expansion programs are not required to follow traditional Medicaid coverage rules.\n         Instead, they must adhere to the Essential Health Benefits standard that applies to Qualified\n         Health Plans (“QHPs”) sold on federal or state Marketplaces, whereby the formulary must\n         include at least as many drugs as covered by a benchmark plan for each United States\n         Pharmacopeia (“USP”) category and class, with no less than one drug per category and class. In\n         practice, however, most states have been adopting the standard FFS formulary for the\n         expansion population, and therefore these two populations’ formularies predominantly remain\n         the same.\n\n         CMS recently declined to adopt the use of the American Hospital Formulary Services (“AHFS”)\n         classification system instead of the USP system for QHP formularies. Nonetheless, a state could\n         still require its Medicaid FFS formulary to use AHFS. Because the AHFS taxonomy is more\n         detailed, adopting it in combination with a requirement to cover at least one drug per class\n         would ultimately lead to the coverage of more drugs – including those used treat rare diseases.\n         Notably, AHFS currently places Kalydeco in its own class.\n\n         Finally, there is no federal requirement that Medicaid managed care organizations (“MCOs”)\n         cover drugs subject to rebate agreements, although states may elect to impose their own\n         requirements (e.g., mandating plans cover certain drugs or all drugs on the state formulary).\n         Thus, MCOs have significant latitude in determining the content of their formularies, subject to\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f         state restrictions and the requirement that they provide medically necessary care. The state\n         Medicaid agency is responsible for monitoring and enforcing MCOs’ compliance with any\n         applicable restrictions and requirements the state imposed. Draft Medicaid managed care\n         regulations scheduled to be promulgated in early 2015 may address the issue of MCO formulary\n         flexibility.\n\n         Vertex’s Position\n         To ensure initial placement of medically necessary drugs (including Kalydeco and Combo) on\n         state Medicaid formularies, Vertex would propose the following:\n             • Therapeutic equivalency:\n                    o State Medicaid agencies and MCOs should be required to include on formulary\n                         any medically necessary drug for which there is no therapeutic equivalent.\n                    o The AHFS classification system should be used to determine therapeutic\n                         equivalency.\n             • Timing of formulary determination:\n                    o DUR Boards, P&T Committees and MCOs should be required to initiate review of\n                         a new drug within 60 days of FDA approval, and make a formulary determination\n                         within 90 days.1 Expedited reviews should be available for drugs for which there\n                         is no therapeutic equivalent.\n                    o Patients should be able to access any medically necessary drug through PA while\n                         a new drug is under review.\n\n         Strategic Pathways\n         These policy positions can be achieved through several different means outlined below. The\n         approach in each state will vary depending on the specific policy making dynamics and\n         statutory/regulatory framework in that state.\n             • Subregulatory guidance: The Medicaid agency and DUR Board/P&T Committee\n                determine which drugs are on formulary.\n             • Legislation: While legislation codifies the policy, it is more difficult than leveraging\n                agency guidance. Legislation may be needed to place time limits on a state’s formulary\n                decisions.\n             • Regulation: While potentially easier to secure regulatory change (especially if the policy\n                has the backing of the Medicaid agency) than legislative change, regulations still require\n                a notice and comment process.\n             • MCO contracts: The Medicaid agency has wide latitude to implement policy through\n                contracts with MCOs, subject to any state or federal statutes or regulation.\n\n         State Examples:\n             •     Therapeutic equivalency: Instead of the USP system, Alabama uses the AHFS\n                   classification system to define drug classes in Medicaid FFS.\n\n         1\n          Medicare Part D has a somewhat longer timeframe: initial reviews must be undertaken within 90 days, and the\n         formulary determination must occur within 180 days.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                       o MCO consideration: Illinois has a statute requiring MCO formularies to be no\n                           more restrictive than the state’s FFS formulary (note that there are concerns as\n                           to whether states adequately enforce this type of requirement). Therefore if, a\n                           state adopted both Alabama’s and Illinois’s policies, it would effectively require\n                           MCOs to use the AHFS system as well.\n             •     Timing of formulary decisions: Some states have established policies that set a timeline\n                   for drug review. Indiana’s DUR Board is required to assess a new drug within 60 days of\n                   FDA approval. The drug cannot be subject to PA during this interim period if it is the sole\n                   drug in a new therapeutic classification. Louisiana requires new drugs to be added to\n                   the formulary as soon as they are commercially available, and its P&T Committee then\n                   reviews to determine if the drug should be removed. (Louisiana, however, allows the\n                   P&T Committee to consider cost effectiveness in deciding whether to remove the drug\n                   from formulary, which is arguably a violation of federal law.) New York requires MCOs to\n                   have a process in place to review new FDA approved drugs within 90 days of their\n                   approval.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                                    Exhibit A: Formulary Inclusion Model Language\n\n         A State’s Medicaid program shall include on its formulary all prescription drugs for which there\n         is no therapeutic equivalent.\n\n         A managed care organization providing care under the State’s Medicaid program shall include\n         on its formulary all prescription drugs for which there is no therapeutic equivalent.\n\n         A drug has no therapeutic equivalent if it is the sole member of a drug class as determined by\n         the American Hospital Formulary Services classification system.\n\n\n                                Exhibit B: Formulary Decision Timing Model Language\n\n         A State’s Medicaid program shall make a reasonable effort to review a new FDA approved drug\n         product (or a new FDA approved indication) within 60 days of the drug’s release onto the\n         market. The Medicaid program shall make a decision as to whether to cover the drug on its\n         formulary within 90 days of the drug’s release onto the market. The Medicaid program shall\n         provide an expedited process for review under which coverage decisions are made within 60\n         days for drugs for which there is no therapeutic equivalent to ensure availability of the drug for\n         patients in need.2\n\n         A managed care organization providing care under the State’s Medicaid program shall make a\n         reasonable effort to review a new FDA approved drug product (or a new FDA approved\n         indication) within 60 days of the drug’s release onto the market. The managed care organization\n         shall make a decision as to whether to cover the drug on its formulary within 90 days of the\n         drug’s release onto the market. The managed care organization shall provide an expedited\n         process for review under which coverage decisions are made within 60 days for drugs for which\n         there is no therapeutic equivalent to ensure availability of the drug for patients in need.\n\n\n\n\n         2\n          This language is based on Medicare Part D rules and the ASHP Guidelines on the Pharmacy and Therapeutics\n         Committee and the Formulary System; Part D has a 180-day review timeframe. See Medicaid Prescription Drug\n         Benefit Manual, Chapter 6 – Part D Drugs and Formulary Requirements § 30.1.5; ASHP Guidelines on the Pharmacy\n         and Therapeutics Committee and the Formulary System (2008). Recent CMS guidance also requires QHPs to\n         review new drugs within 180 days. See Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and\n         Payment Parameters for 2016; CMS-9944-F. (Feb. 20, 2015). While the model language calls for determinations\n         within 90 days (60 days for drugs lacking a therapeutic equivalent), CMS’s 180-day standard is a potential\n         alternative.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	Lead-_Getting_the_Drug_on_Formulary_259-262.pdf	PDF	13	70	f	2017-08-14 05:21:48.973806	2017-08-21 07:03:04.590623	t	188667	1	184 KB
49	Lead: Limits on Prior Authorization Criteria	                                        Lead: Limits on Prior Authorization Criteria\n\n         Background\n         In order to manage costs and utilization, states may require prescribers to seek “prior\n         authorization” before a prescription is filled. States have wide latitude to decide which drugs are\n         subject to prior authorization (“PA”) and the PA criteria. States, however, must ensure that\n         medically necessary drugs are covered. Typically, a state’s Drug Utilization Review (“DUR”)\n         Board or Pharmacy & Therapeutics (“P&T”) Committee is responsible for developing PA criteria,\n         although states often turn to outside organizations to draft those criteria.\n\n         In those states with Medicaid managed care programs, the health plans decide which drugs are\n         covered on the formulary and which are subject to prior authorization. Medicaid managed care\n         plans generally have the freedom to set their own PA policies, although they must cover\n         medically necessary drugs. Health plan formularies are typically set by the plan’s medical\n         director in consultation with the plan’s pharmacy benefit manager (“PBM”). In some cases,\n         health plans use P&T Committees to consult on prior authorization rules and formulary\n         development.\n\n         Many states and managed care organizations (“MCOs”) will use the drug’s Food and Drug\n         Administration’s (“FDA”) approved “label” as the basis for the prior authorization criteria. The\n         label describes the conditions the drug is intended to treat, the populations the drug is\n         approved for, proper dosage, and adverse drug reactions, among other information. (Prior\n         authorization to label is a good standard for Vertex products.) Increasingly, states and MCOs\n         are developing criteria that are stricter than the contents of the FDA label, which result in\n         reduced patient access.1 In some states, these restrictive rules are being used as a means of\n         containing costs at the expense of denying medically necessary care.\n\n         The content of the FDA’s label is not the only source of information for prior authorization\n         criteria. States and managed care organizations also turn to treatment guidelines developed by\n         professional medical societies. These guidelines can be more or less restrictive than the limits\n         described in the FDA label.\n\n         While the prior authorization criteria generally determine drug access, that is not the case if a\n         state adopts a “prescriber prevails” policy. Under prescriber prevails, if a prescriber indicates\n         that a drug is medically necessary for the treatment of a patient’s condition, then the state or\n         MCO must cover the drug regardless of the prior authorization criteria. The prescriber’s\n         authority is not unlimited; states may continue to deny coverage where there would be a\n         dangerous interaction with another drug or other state-specified criteria.\n\n\n         1\n          For example, Colorado’s criteria require ALT and AST (liver function tests) to have been assessed prior to\n         dispensing of Kalydeco, and those tests must be within two times of the normal limits (the FDA only warns against\n         using Kalydeco when the tests are not within five times the normal limits).\n\n                                                                  1\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f         Vertex’s Position\n         To ensure that state prior authorization rules do not block access to medically necessary drugs,\n         Vertex would propose the following, listed in order of preference:\n             • Prior authorization criteria. As an initial approach, Vertex would advance a\n                requirement—through legislation, regulation, subregulatory guidance and/or MCO\n                contract provisions—to ensure that PA criteria used by the state and MCOs are no more\n                restrictive than the FDA label and are appropriate relative to treatment guidelines.\n             • Expert consultation: In states where the above approach is not possible, Vertex would\n                seek legislation, regulation, subregulatory guidance or MCO contract provisions\n                requiring the state Medicaid agency and MCOs to consult rare disease experts when\n                developing PA for drugs used to treat rare diseases (sometimes called “orphan drugs”).\n             • Prescriber prevails: If none of the approaches described above are feasible, Vertex\n                would seek to have implemented a prescriber prevails policy for orphan drugs. This\n                policy would apply to state fee-for-service programs and Medicaid managed care\n                organizations.\n\n         Strategic Pathways\n         These policy positions can be achieved through several different means outlined below. The\n         approach in each state will vary depending on the specific policy making dynamics and\n         statutory/regulatory framework in that state.\n             • Subregulatory guidance: The Medicaid agency and DUR Board/ P&T Committee set PA\n                criteria and have the power to modify those criteria.\n             • Legislation: While legislation codifies the policy, it is more difficult than leveraging\n                agency guidance. Legislation would likely be needed to implement a prescriber prevails\n                policy as Medicaid agencies are typically unable to adopt such a policy without statutory\n                direction.\n             • Regulation: While potentially easier to secure regulatory change (especially if the policy\n                has the backing of the Medicaid agency) than legislative change, regulations still require\n                a notice and comment process.\n             • MCO contracts: The Medicaid agency has wide latitude to implement policy through\n                contracts with MCOs, subject to any state or federal statutes or regulation.\n\n         State Examples:\n             •     Prior authorization criteria: States have not enacted policies that would require PA\n                   criteria to match the FDA label for all drugs subject to PA. However, some states have\n                   more favorable PA criteria for Kalydeco than others. For example, West Virginia allows\n                   access to Kalydeco so long as the patient has cystic fibrosis with one of nine genetic\n                   mutations, is older than 6, and is not currently taking a CYP3A inducer (a group of drugs\n                   that the FDA warns against taking with Kalydeco).\n             •     Expert consultation: States do not require Medicaid Agencies to consult with rare\n                   disease experts in the development of PA criteria for rare disease drugs. As a practical\n                   matter, states from time to time do consult with outside experts. Indiana requires\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   consultation with a mental health committee when developing PA criteria for mental\n                   health drugs.\n             •     Prescriber prevails: New York allows the prescriber’s decision to prevail in its fee-for-\n                   service Medicaid program. New York law also requires MCOs under its managed care\n                   program (which has significantly higher enrollment than the fee-for-service program) to\n                   follow a prescriber prevails policy for nine different classes of drugs, including certain\n                   mental health and HIV drugs. Michigan allows the prescriber’s decision to prevail for all\n                   drug classes in one of several circumstances; for example, the prescriber’s decision must\n                   be followed if the drug is being prescribed consistent with licensed indications, if no\n                   other drug can offer comparable benefit, and the drug is necessary for stabilization of\n                   the patient’s condition. Michigan’s law, however, does not apply to MCOs.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                             Exhibit A: Prior Authorization Criteria Proposal Model Language\n\n         Prior authorization criteria applied to a drug shall be no more restrictive than the drug’s FDA\n         label.

50	Lead: Limits on Reauthorization Criteria	                                      Lead: Limits on Reauthorization Criteria\n\n         Background\n         In order to manage costs and utilization, states may require prescribers to seek “prior\n         authorization” before a prescription is filled. Typically, a state’s Drug Utilization Review (“DUR”)\n         Board or Pharmacy & Therapeutics (“P&T”) Committee is responsible for developing prior\n         authorization (“PA”) criteria, although states often turn to outside organizations to draft those\n         criteria. In those states with Medicaid managed care programs, the health plans decide which\n         drugs are covered on the formulary and which are subject to PA. Health plan criteria are\n         typically set by the plan’s medical director in consultation with the plan’s pharmacy benefit\n         manager (“PBM”), although health plans use P&T Committees in some cases.\n\n         The reauthorization criteria, sometimes referred to as the renewal criteria, are an important\n         part of the PA rules. States and managed care organizations (“MCOs”) often impose different\n         rules when patients seek to remain on a drug. These rules can be stricter than those applied to\n         patients who seek to use a drug for the first time. The renewal criteria sometimes also include\n         restrictions that are not mandated in the Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) approved\n         “label,” which describes the conditions the drug is intended to treat, the populations the drug is\n         approved for, proper dosage, and adverse drug reactions, among other information.\n\n         Overly restrictive renewal criteria can be a barrier to patient access. States, for example, may\n         require a demonstration of patient improvement as a condition of approving reauthorization.\n         While proving that a drug actually works is reasonable in theory, in practice that principle can\n         be manipulated. Because cystic fibrosis is a degenerative disease, a patient may benefit from\n         Vertex’s products if the patient’s condition stabilizes but does not improve. Similarly, a patient\n         may see improvement or stabilization in one important area such as weight gain or reduced\n         chloride levels on a sweat test, but if the criteria demand improvement or stabilization in a\n         different metric such as lung function, then the patient is at risk of losing access to the drug.\n\n         Rules related to the length of the reauthorization period may also threaten patient access. If\n         states or MCOs require reauthorization at frequent intervals of three months or less, the\n         practitioner treating the patient may not have sufficient time to monitor the effect of the drug.\n         Frequent reauthorizations may also be an administrative burden on providers and patients.\n\n         Vertex’s Position\n         To ensure that state reauthorization rules do not block access to medically necessary drugs,\n         Vertex would propose the following:\n             • Reauthorization timing. States and MCOs should aim to require reauthorization no\n                more than once per year. If once-a-year reauthorizations are not feasible, then the\n                reauthorization period should be at least as long as the recommended time period\n                between outpatient visits for CF patients (three months).\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f             •     Substance of reauthorization criteria. In terms of the substance of the criteria, Vertex\n                   would propose the following, in order of preference:\n                      o Appropriate relative to treatment guidelines: As an initial approach, Vertex\n                          would advance a requirement—through legislation, regulation, subregulatory\n                          guidance and/or MCO contract provisions—to ensure that reauthorization\n                          criteria used by the state and MCOs are appropriate relative to treatment\n                          guidelines.\n                      o Expert consultation: Vertex would seek legislation, regulation, subregulatory\n                          guidance or MCO contract provisions requiring the state Medicaid agency and\n                          MCOs to consult rare disease experts when developing reauthorization criteria\n                          for drugs used to treat rare diseases (sometimes called “orphan drugs”).\n                      o Prescriber deference: If requiring appropriateness relative to treatment\n                          guidelines and expert consultation is not feasible, then Vertex would seek to\n                          have implemented a policy that requires states and MCOs to defer to a\n                          prescriber’s determination of whether a drug has benefited a particular patient\n                          in cases where reauthorization criteria require a demonstration of clinical\n                          benefit. States and MCOs may require a demonstration of clinical benefit, but it\n                          is up to the patient’s treating practitioner to determine whether such a benefit\n                          exists.\n\n         Strategic Pathways\n         These policy positions can be achieved through several different means outlined below. The\n         approach in each state will vary depending on the specific policy making dynamics and\n         statutory/regulatory framework in that state.\n             • Subregulatory guidance: The Medicaid agency and DUR Board/ P&T Committee set\n                reauthorization criteria and have the power to modify those criteria.\n             • Legislation: While legislation codifies the policy, it is more difficult than leveraging\n                agency guidance.\n             • Regulation: While potentially easier to secure regulatory change (especially if the policy\n                has the backing of the Medicaid agency) than legislative change, regulations still require\n                a notice and comment process.\n             • MCO contracts: The Medicaid agency has wide latitude to implement policy through\n                contracts with MCOs, subject to any state or federal statutes or regulation.\n\n         State Examples:\n             •     Reauthorization timing: States have not enacted policies that set minimum\n                   reauthorization periods. Some states have more favorable reauthorization periods for\n                   Kalydeco than others: North Carolina, for example, allows for one-year reauthorization\n                   periods.\n             •     Reauthorization criteria: States have not enacted policies that would require\n                   reauthorization criteria to be appropriate relative to treatment guidelines. However,\n                   some states are more flexible in approving Kalydeco renewals than others. For example,\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   Georgia and North Carolina do not impose any additional requirements on requests for\n                   reauthorization of Kalydeco.\n             •     Expert consultation: States do not require Medicaid Agencies to consult with rare disease\n                   experts in the development of reauthorization criteria for rare disease drugs. As a\n                   practical matter, states from time to time do consult with outside experts. Indiana\n                   requires consultation with a mental health committee when developing PA criteria for\n                   mental health drugs.\n             •     Physician deference: Nebraska allows physicians to determine whether drug treatment\n                   has been a success for the patient.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                                Exhibit A: Reauthorization Criteria Timing Model Language\n\n         For rare disease drugs, the authorization period under a state Medicaid prior authorization\n         program shall be at least as long as the rare medical condition treatment interval, and shall not\n         be less than three months.\n\n         For rare disease drugs, the authorization period under a Managed Care Organization’s prior\n         authorization program shall be at least as long as the rare medical condition treatment interval,\n         and shall not be less than three months.\n\n         For purposes of this provision:\n             • A ‘rare disease drug’ is a drug used to treat a rare medical condition.\n             • A ‘rare medical condition’ is any disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000\n                persons in the United States, such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, and multiple myeloma.1\n             • A ‘rare medical condition treatment interval’ means the recommended time period\n                between visits to a primary care practitioner or specialist of a person with a given rare\n                medical condition. For example, if treatment guidelines recommend that a patient with\n                a particular rare medical condition schedule an outpatient visit at least three times a\n                year, then the rare medical condition treatment interval is four months for that\n                condition.\n\n                              Exhibit B: Reauthorization Criteria Proposal Model Language\n\n         Reauthorization criteria shall only use restrictions that are considered appropriate under\n         nationally recognized treatment guidelines.\n\n         “Nationally recognized treatment guidelines” means guidelines issued by expert medical\n         organizations, and may include guidelines issued by the National Guideline Clearinghouse,\n         medical societies, or other organizations that are recognized for expertise in treating a\n         particular condition or conditions.\n\n                                       Exhibit C: Expert Consultation Model Language\n\n         The [Name of State’s Medicaid agency] shall develop and maintain a list of external experts\n         who, because of their special expertise, are qualified to provide advice on rare disease issues.\n         The state’s [DUR Board, P&T Committee] shall consult with such experts on the state’s rare\n         disease expert list when developing prior authorization and reauthorization criteria for a rare\n         disease drug.

First, they must decide whether the drug should be included on formulary.\n         Second, assuming the drug is on formulary, the program must determine whether it is subject\n         to prior authorization (“PA”). And if the drug is subject to PA, the program must set the PA and\n         reauthorization criteria.\n\n         In the case of fee-for-service programs, a state’s Drug Utilization Review (“DUR”) Board or\n         Pharmacy & Therapeutics (“P&T”) Committee typically is responsible for making\n         recommendations as to whether a drug is on formulary or subject to PA (although states often\n         turn to outside organizations for assistance) and the Medicaid director has final say. In\n         managed care, a plan’s medical director in consultation with the plan’s pharmacy benefit\n         manager (“PBM”) often makes these decisions, although in some cases, health plans consult\n         with their own P&T Committees.\n\n         Given the importance of formulary and PA decisions to beneficiary access to needed drugs, it is\n         critical that these decisions be made in as transparent a manner as possible. Federal statutes\n         and regulations do not require DUR Boards/ P&T Committees to meet in public, although a\n         court decision has found that federal law requires states to make their PA criteria available to\n         patients. Generally, however, the extent to which coverage decisions are transparent depends\n         on state law. States vary in terms of what they require their Medicaid programs to make public.\n         And states that have robust transparency rules in their fee-for-service programs often fail to\n         apply such rules to Medicaid managed care organizations (“MCOs”).\n\n         Vertex’s Position\n         To ensure that states and MCOs make their drug coverage decisions in transparent a manner as\n         possible, Vertex would propose the following:\n             • Public meetings. Vertex would advance a requirement—through legislation or\n                regulation—to require states to make their DUR Board and P&T Committee meetings\n                open to the public, and to require states to provide sufficient advance notice of those\n                meetings.\n             • Publication of coverage rules: Vertex would seek legislation, regulation, or subregulatory\n                guidance to require states to make their formularies and PA publicly available, to the\n                extent that information is not currently available.\n             • Applicability to MCOs: At the very least, Medicaid MCOs must make their formularies\n                and PA criteria publicly available. If feasible, Vertex would also seek legislation,\n                regulation or MCO contractual provisions requiring MCOs to use P&T Committees and\n                make the meetings of those committees open to the public.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f         Strategic Pathways\n         These policy positions can be achieved through several different means outlined below. The\n         approach in each state will vary depending on the specific policy making dynamics and\n         statutory/regulatory framework in that state.\n             • Subregulatory guidance: While many aspects of the transparency proposal may require\n                legislation or regulation, advocacy to the Medicaid agency or DUR Board/ P&T\n                Committee may be sufficient to convince those bodies to publish their formularies and\n                PA criteria in states where this does not currently occur.\n             • Legislation: Legislation would likely be needed to implement the requirements that\n                meetings be held in public.\n             • Regulation: In some states, it is possible that increased transparency could be achieved\n                through regulatory changes. While potentially easier to secure regulatory change\n                (especially if the policy has the backing of the Medicaid agency) than legislative change,\n                regulations still require a notice and comment process.\n             • MCO contracts: The Medicaid agency has wide latitude to implement policy through\n                contracts with MCOs, subject to any state or federal statutes or regulation. If the\n                reforms target MCOs, then changes to the contracts will be necessary. However, if a\n                state seeks to impose a public meeting requirement on MCO committees, legislative or\n                regulatory change may be necessary as well.\n\n         State Examples:\n             •     Notification of meetings: New York’s statute requires its DUR Board to post 30 day\n                   advance notice of its meetings on its website. Maine’s regulations require notice of its\n                   DUR Board meetings to be published in newspapers and to be provided to state medical\n                   associations.\n             •     Open meetings: Many states require the meetings of their DUR Board and P&T\n                   Committee to be open to the public. Maine requires the portion of their meetings that\n                   involve “the process of decision making” to be open to the public so long as that portion\n                   does not involve confidential or protected information. Unlike most states, Louisiana\n                   requires each MCO to establish a P&T Committee to develop its formulary, and the\n                   meetings of those P&T Committees must be public.\n             •     Availability of materials: Louisiana’s statute requires its meeting minutes and non-\n                   confidential meeting material to be accessible to the public. California’s statute requires\n                   its PA criteria to be published in provider manuals. New Jersey “strongly encourages” its\n                   MCOs to make their formularies publicly available on their websites.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                   Exhibit A: Transparency Proposal Model Language for Fee-for-Service Programs\n\n         The Medicaid agency shall provide public notice on its website of any meeting of the [DUR\n         Board and/or P&T Committee] at least 30 days prior to the date of that meeting. Such notice\n         shall include a list of drug products to be reviewed and the proposals to be considered by the\n         [DUR Board and/or P&T Committee], including the text of any proposed rules or criteria to be\n         discussed. In addition to posting notice on the website, the Medicaid agency shall provide\n         notice to any stakeholders who inform the agency of their interest in [DUR Board and/or P&T\n         Committee] meetings at least 30 days prior to the date of those meetings. Such stakeholders\n         may include medical societies, managed care organizations, patient advocacy groups,\n         pharmaceutical manufacturers, prescribers, and patients.\n\n         The [DUR Board and/or P&T Committee] shall meet only in public. The portions of the meeting\n         that involve the process of decision making shall also be open to the public. The [DUR Board\n         and/or P&T Committee] meeting may be temporarily closed to the public to address\n         confidential or protected information, but the meeting shall be reopened as soon as\n         practicable. The [DUR Board and/or P&T Committee] shall allow interested parties a reasonable\n         opportunity to make an oral presentation to the [DUR Board and/or P&T Committee] related to\n         the drug(s) being reviewed prior to the [DUR Board and/or P&T Committee] making any\n         decisions about the drug(s) being discussed.\n\n         Minutes of the [DUR Board and/or P&T Committee] shall be made available to the public on the\n         Medicaid agency’s website within five days after the minutes are approved. All documents that\n         are distributed to the [DUR Board and/or P&T Committee] and not subject to state or federal\n         confidentiality laws shall be made available to the public on the Medicaid agency’s website\n         within five days after the [DUR Board and/or P&T Committee] meets.\n\n         The Medicaid agency shall make its formulary and prior authorization criteria publicly available\n         on its website. When the Medicaid agency’s formulary or prior authorization criteria are\n         modified, the new version of the formulary and/or prior authorization criteria must be made\n         publicly available on the website prior to its implementation.1\n\n                   Exhibit B: Transparency Proposal Model Language for Managed Care Programs\n\n         The managed care organization shall make its formulary and prior authorization criteria publicly\n         available on its website. The managed care organization shall ensure that the published\n         formulary and prior authorization criteria are up-to-date, accurate, and complete.\n\n         1\n          The language in this appendix and the following appendix is based on language used by California, Louisiana,\n         Maine, New Jersey, and New York.

52	Follow: Medicaid Strategies	                                              Follow: Medicaid Strategies\n\n         Background\n         Several strategies that could help Medicaid patients access cystic fibrosis drugs likely will require\n         partnerships with other organizations rather than Vertex advocating for certain policies alone.\n         Some of these strategies—such as adopting a prescriber prevails system that applies to rare\n         disease drugs or establishing a protected class that cover such drugs—will help ensure that\n         patients in need have access to these pharmaceuticals. However, states are typically reluctant to\n         apply such blanket policies and traditionally have limited them to certain classes of drugs that\n         do not include cystic fibrosis drugs. Therefore, Vertex should pursue such policies only if\n         potential partners demonstrate interest in such reforms and said reforms specifically enable\n         access to Vertex products.\n\n         Other policies may also have an impact on the coverage of cystic fibrosis drugs, but do not\n         guarantee that these drugs will be covered on the State’s preferred drug list or the Medicaid\n         managed care organization’s (“MCO”) formulary. MCO value scorecards for rare disease drugs\n         and risk corridors/reinsurance for high drug costs could give health plans more of an incentive\n         to allow sufficient patient access to cystic fibrosis drugs. These access-promoting strategies are\n         also more likely to be achieved if other organizations take steps to initiate these changes\n         partnering with Vertex, as appropriate.\n\n         The remainder of this paper describes these strategies in more detail.\n\n         MCO Value Scorecards\n             •     Vertex’s Position: States should develop a value scorecard that incorporates measures\n                   relevant to patients with rare diseases and incentivize MCOs that meet certain\n                   benchmarks with bonus payments (or withholds for those that do not). These programs\n                   give MCOs an incentive to provide high quality care to patients with rare diseases.\n             •     State Example(s): While many states assess MCOs on quality measures and have\n                   developed quality incentive programs, none use quality measures specific to rare\n                   diseases.\n             •     Strategic Pathway: States can adopt quality scorecards through amendments to their\n                   managed care contracts. However, states are unlikely to develop rare disease metrics\n                   on their own and are likely to rely on outside organizations for such measures. Given\n                   this, a “pilot state” should be identified for developing the metrics and testing such an\n                   approach.\n\n         MCO Risk Corridors/Reinsurance\n             •     Vertex’s Position: States should establish a risk corridor or reinsurance program under\n                   which MCOs receive additional payments from the state if their total drug spend, or CF\n                   specific/ rare disease drug spend, exceeds a certain amount.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f             •     State Example(s): Virginia has a reinsurance program for Kalydeco. Under that program,\n                   when an MCO beneficiary receives Kalydeco, the State pays the MCO the lesser of the\n                   amount the MCO paid for the drug or the amount that the State would have paid for the\n                   drug under its fee-for-service program. The MCOs pay for the cost of reinsurance\n                   through a reduction in the capitation amount otherwise owed to them. Similarly, Arizona\n                   has a catastrophic reinsurance program under which it covers up to 85% of the costs for\n                   certain high cost drugs, including Kalydeco. New York is also considering a stop loss\n                   program where the State assumes risk for all drugs once the pharmacy spend for an\n                   individual exceeds a certain threshold.\n             •     Strategic Pathway: Following Virginia and Arizona, a state likely has the ability to\n                   implement a risk corridor or reinsurance program through amendments to its managed\n                   care contracts.\n\n         Prescriber Prevails\n             •     Vertex’s Position: The prescriber has final authority as to whether a patient has access to\n                   CF or other rare disease drugs.\n             •     State Example(s): New York law requires MCOs under its managed care program to\n                   follow a prescriber prevails policy for nine different classes of drugs, including certain\n                   mental health and HIV drugs. New York also allows the prescriber’s decision to prevail in\n                   its fee-for-service Medicaid program, although the state’s governor has proposed\n                   eliminating FFS prescriber prevails in the current budget. New York may require the\n                   prescriber to submit an appropriate prior authorization (“PA”) request, ensure that the\n                   drug does not trigger any adverse drug interactions, subject the prescriber to a\n                   consultation with a pharmacist and/or confirm that the treatment is consistent with FDA\n                   Compendia.\n             •     Strategic Pathway: A state would likely need legislation to adopt prescriber prevails.\n\n         Protected Classes\n             •     Vertex’s Position: CF drugs should be a protected class, thus either prohibiting the\n                   implementation of PA on that class or limiting the use of PA.\n             •     State Example(s): Hawaii’s statute forbids all restrictions on access to antipsychotics and\n                   also generally prohibits restrictions on access to antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs,\n                   although PA and step therapy are allowed for these latter two classes in some\n                   circumstances. Hawaii’s law applies both to its fee-for-service and managed care\n                   program. Indiana’s statute similarly forbids PA on many mental health drugs in both the\n                   fee-for-service and managed care programs. Louisiana’s statute also prohibits PA on\n                   certain HIV, mental health, and hepatitis C drugs, although this prohibition applies only\n                   to its fee-for-service program.\n             •     Strategic Pathway: States typically establish protected classes through legislation.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	Follow-_Medicaid_Strategies_277-278.pdf	PDF	13	74	f	2017-08-14 05:23:52.536439	2017-08-21 07:03:05.248902	t	129287	1	126 KB
53	Follow: Qualified Health Plan Strategies	                                         Follow: Qualified Health Plan Strategies\n\n         Background\n         Certain strategies to increase access to cystic fibrosis drugs among patients with coverage\n         through Qualified Health Plans (“QHPs) purchased on federal or state Marketplaces will likely\n         be most successfully pursued in partnership with other stakeholders. Two of such policy\n         strategies are discussed below.\n\n         First, in an effort to contain prescription drug costs, some QHPs are placing high-cost specialty\n         drugs – many of which are used to treat debilitating chronic conditions – on a formulary tier of\n         their own. This “specialty tier” is typically the highest tier on a formulary with the most\n         burdensome cost-sharing requirements, including high coinsurance. Consumers of specialty\n         tier drugs will therefore face a significant cost-sharing financial burden until they hit their\n         annual out-of-pocket maximum.\n\n         CMS has commented that a QHP may be engaging in illegal discrimination if it places most or all\n         drugs that treat a specific condition on the highest tier, as doing so dissuades individuals with\n         that condition from enrolling in the plan.1 Some states limit the use of specialty tiers and/or limit\n         cost-sharing for specialty drugs; other states are considering such policies. However, states may\n         be reluctant to adopt a sweeping ban on specialty tiers altogether, and legislation may not\n         specifically address classes of cystic fibrosis.\n\n         Second, plan formulary transparency is crucial for individuals to be able to make informed\n         decisions to elect QHPs that will cover the drugs they need. Regardless, patients continue to\n         experience considerable challenges in accessing formulary data on federal and state\n         Marketplaces. Under recent final rules from CMS,2 beginning in 2016 QHP issuers must provide\n         direct URLs to their formularies on their websites, enabling consumers to view up-to-date\n         information on all drugs under coverage. QHPs in the federal Marketplace, specifically, must\n         also make their formulary information “machine readable” to enable the creation of look-up\n         tools to simplify the plan selection process. Further, issuers must publically share information\n         on plan tiering structure and “any restrictions on the manner in which a drug can be obtained.”\n         Overall, these new rules will ultimately help QHP beneficiaries with cystic fibrosis elect plans\n         that cover cystic fibrosis drugs.\n\n         The remainder of this paper discusses these two policy strategies in greater detail.\n\n\n\n\n         1,2\n           Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2016; CMS-\n         9944-F. (Feb. 20, 2015).\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f         Specialty Tiers\n             •     Vertex’s Position: QHPs should be prohibited from using specialty tiers, and/or should be\n                   required to limit cost sharing for specialty drugs.\n             •     State Example(s): New York expressly prohibits the use of specialty tiers by QHPs.\n                   Delaware prohibits plans from putting all drugs in a given class on a specialty tier and\n                   lists cystic fibrosis as a rare condition covered under the specialty tier law. Maryland\n                   and Louisiana, in addition to Delaware, have passed laws that limit specialty tier cost\n                   sharing to $150 for a 30-day supply of a specialty-tier drug.\n             •     Strategic Pathway: Specialty-tier limitations typically require codification in legislation or\n                   regulations.\n\n         Coverage transparency\n             •     Vertex’s position: QHPs should be required to make information on their formulary,\n                   tiering structure, and PA criteria easily accessible to the public. QHPs should\n                   additionally provide formulary look-up tools to enhance the plan selection process.\n             •     State example(s): During 2014 Open Enrollment, Nevada was the only state with a look-\n                   up tool allowing consumers to search for which plans’ formularies cover a certain drug.\n             •     Strategic pathway: Enactment of CMS’s final rule addressed many of Vertex’s concerns\n                   about transparency. However, advocacy at the state level may be necessary to achieve\n                   additional transparency requirements, as they typically require codification in legislation\n                   or regulations. Vertex should partner with other stakeholders with shared interests to\n                   advocate for additional transparency requirements not required by CMS at this time that\n                   would benefit cystic fibrosis patients (e.g., requiring detailed cost-sharing information\n                   and drug prior authorization (“PA”) criteria to be publicized).\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	Follow-_Qualified_Health_Plan_Strategies_279-280.pdf	PDF	13	75	f	2017-08-14 05:24:13.61023	2017-08-21 07:03:05.410651	t	127522	1	125 KB
54	Watch: Qualified Health Plan Strategies	                                       Watch: Qualified Health Plan Strategies\n\n         Background\n         Given that coverage in the federal and state Marketplaces is still new and that the number of\n         enrollees with CF is likely low, the extent to which beneficiaries enrolled in Qualified Health\n         Plans (“QHPs”) might face challenges in accessing needed CF drugs is not yet completely clear.\n         CMS and states are still revising their approach on issues that have an impact on\n         pharmaceutical access. The best approach for now is to monitor these issues. If changes occur\n         that call patient access to CF drugs into question, a more proactive position may be more\n         appropriate.\n\n         One potential issue is the adoption of a standard plan design. States have the option of\n         standardizing cost sharing for QHPs. Standard plan design is aimed at assisting beneficiaries in\n         choosing plans so that they can compare plans based on premium costs and networks.\n         Standard plan design with low specialty drug cost sharing can help patients access CF drugs.\n         But these standards also have the potential to reduce drug access. For example, Oregon\n         requires its silver plans to have 50% coinsurance for specialty drugs, a high rate that can\n         discourage beneficiaries from obtaining needed drugs. Most states have not yet adopted a\n         standard plan design, so others may seek to do so in upcoming years.\n\n         Since beneficiaries will change Marketplace coverage, issues associated with churning are also a\n         potential access barrier. A beneficiary may have already undertaken step therapy—the process\n         of trying a lower cost drug before moving on to a higher cost, potentially more effective drug—\n         in a previous plan. If a QHP requires that beneficiary to try step therapy again in the new plan,\n         this could cause beneficiaries to lose access to needed CF drugs. CMS has encouraged QHPs to\n         provide transitional fills for new enrollees, but has not required them to do so.\n\n         The remainder of this paper describes these strategies in more detail.\n\n         Standard Plan Design\n\n             •     Vertex’s Position: If a state adopts a standard plan design, that design should ensure\n                   that plans have low cost sharing for specialty drugs that are needed by patients with\n                   rare diseases.\n             •     State Example(s): New York prohibits coinsurance for any drugs offered in Marketplace\n                   plans. Copayments may range from $30 to $70 for brand name drugs, depending in part\n                   on the metal tier and whether the drug is on formulary.\n             •     Strategic Pathway: States typically adopt standard plan design through regulations,\n                   although some states (such as New York) do not have regulations that govern their\n                   Marketplaces.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f         Transition Fills\n             •     Vertex’s Position: QHPs should have more transition policies for drug coverage for new\n                   beneficiaries who are transitioning from other plans. QHPs should cover nonformulary\n                   drugs for at least the first 30 days that a beneficiary is enrolled in a plan. QHPs should\n                   not be able to impose step therapy requirements if the beneficiary already undertook\n                   step therapy with a previous plan.\n             •     State Example(s): States have so far not developed transition fill protections.\n             •     Strategic Pathway: In early 2014, CMS had considered requiring temporary coverage of\n                   non-formulary drugs but withdrew its proposal; in its February 2015 final rule CMS\n                   reiterated its position that it will not require plans to provide transition fills, although it\n                   encourages them to do so. It is possible that advocacy efforts in combination with\n                   partners could cause CMS to reconsider. At the state level, transition fill requirements\n                   could be imposed through QHP contract provisions or regulations.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	Watch-_Qualified_Health_Plan_Strategies_281-281.pdf	PDF	13	76	f	2017-08-14 05:24:34.28693	2017-08-21 07:03:05.53679	t	125849	1	123 KB

To deactivate, either choose Help > Deactivate or check the Deactivate checkbox during\nthe uninstall process.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fTrial software\nEntering a serial number\n\nEnter the serial number for the software you purchased in the serialization screen. The serialization\nscreen will load the first time you launch the application. You can enter a serial number for the\napplication itself or a serial number for any Creative Suite that contains the application. If the\nproduct you purchased is one of the Creative Suites, you can enter the serial number in any of the\napplications contained in the Creative Suite. Other applications installed as part of the same Creative\nSuite will recognize the new serial number the next time the applications are launched.\n\nOnly applications running as a trial will recognize the new serial number. If any of the applications\nhave already been serialized with a different serial number, they will continue to use that serial\nnumber until you remove the older serial number using Help > Deactivate > Deactivate\nPermanently. After selecting this option, they will recognize the new serial number on the next\nlaunch of the application.\n\nThe serial number you purchased is for the use of the software in a specific language, and will only\nbe accepted by a product installed in that language.\n\nVolume licensing\n\nVolume licensing customers cannot purchase from a trial directly. However, a volume licensing\nserial number can be used to serialize all Creative Suite applications, except the Acrobat 9 trial or\nretail versions that ship with Creative Suite. Photoshop CS5 volume licensing software must be\npurchased from an authorized Adobe licensing center. Please contact your reseller or authorized\nAdobe licensing center to place an order for a volume license.

Visit\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/creativesuite/creativesuite5.html to find our OpenType\n                                                5\n\fUser Guide, OpenType Read Me, links to font-specific Read Me documents, listings of fonts\ninstalled by the different CS5 products, and listings of fonts included on DVD for each of the CS5\nproducts.\n\nThe Creative Suite 5 installer installs fonts into a default system font directory. Many of these fonts\nare newer versions of fonts installed by Creative Suite 4. If the installer finds older versions of these\nfonts in the default system font directory, it will uninstall the older versions, and save them to a new\ndirectory. The default system font directory is:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Fonts\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Windows\\Fonts\n\nThe older fonts will be saved in the new directory:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Application Support/Adobe/SavedFonts/current\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\SavedFonts\\current\n\nThis new directory will also contain a file named "Read Me.html" which lists the saved fonts, as\nwell as the version numbers of the new and old font files.\n\nYou can re-install the older fonts by deleting the new font files from the default system font\ndirectory and moving the old files back into that directory.\n\nThere are additional fonts on the installation disc. For information on installing these fonts, see\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fontinstall_en.\n\nKnown issues\nPlease refer to Adobe Support for late-breaking information and known issues for all Creative Suite\n5 applications.\n\n64-bit issues\n\nOn Macintosh only, several plug-ins are no longer supported for 64-bit systems. These plug-ins will\nonly run in 32-bit mode:\n\n   •   Embed/Read Watermark\n   •   Lighting Effects\n   •   Send Video Preview to Device\n   •   Variations\n   •   Video Preview\n   •   Optional plug-ins (Contact Sheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI, Web Photo Gallery).\n       NOTE: These plug-ins are not included in your Photoshop CS5 install. You can find more\n       info at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain the\n       plug-ins along with the Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fYou may encounter instabilities with some third-party Carbon plug-ins from CS4 or earlier. We\ntherefore recommend that you do not copy third-party plug-ins directly to the Photoshop Plug-ins\nfolder. Third-party plug-ins should be stored in a separate folder and then loaded via Preferences >\nPlug-ins > Additional Plug-ins. If instabilities occur in the app, either through general use or when\nusing a plug-in directly, follow the plug-in troubleshooting guidelines\nat go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb409112_en-us to resolve the issue.\n\nExtract plug-in\n\nThe Extract plug-in is no longer supported in Photoshop CS5. We highly recommend you use\nRefine Edge and the Quick Select Tool for optimal selections.\n\nGB18030 support for Windows XP\n\nIn order to support the display of all characters of the Chinese standard GB18030 on Windows XP\nsystems, Adobe recommends the installation of the Microsoft GB18030 Support Package. This\nsupport package will update an XP system with, among other things, fonts and input-method-editors\n(IMEs) to correctly support GB18030. The support package is available as a download from the\nMicrosoft website.\n\nGPU and video card support\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 includes support for graphics card acceleration by using the graphics card's\n       Graphics Processing Unit. On Windows XP, or if you are using an unsupported card,\n       OpenGL is turned off by default. This means that features that rely on GPU support will not\n       be available. For a list of features relying on this support, refer to the GPU guidance\n       at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n   •   The Nvidia 7300GT will not work properly with OpenGL on Macintosh systems prior to\n       10.6. We advise you to upgrade to 10.6 if you would like to enable OpenGL functionality.\n\nHow-To links (Help > How To...)\n\nAll How-To links have been removed from Photoshop CS5.\n\nJPEG 2000\n\nThis plug-in is now included in the Photoshop CS5 default install. You no longer need to install it\n(from Photoshop CS4) as an optional plug-in.\n\nOptional plug-ins not installed in Photoshop CS5 and downloadable online\n\n   •   PDF Presentation and Web Photo Gallery can be found in Bridge CS5 in the Adobe Output\n       Model (AOM). If you want to download the Photoshop CS5 versions of PDF Presentation\n       and Web Photo Gallery, please see the following document for\n       information: go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain\n       the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fNOTE: The Web Photo Gallery plug-in does not work in Photoshop Mac 64-bit; you must launch\nPhotoshop in 32-bit mode to use this legacy plug-in on the Mac.\n\n   •   ContactSheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI and Picture Package are also not installed in\n       Photoshop CS5 along with the Textures and Layouts presets. If you want to download these\n       plug-ins, you can find them at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download\n       package will contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\nNOTE: ContactSheet, PatternMaker and Photomerge plug-ins do not work on Photoshop Mac 64-\nbit; you must launch Photoshop in 32-bit mode to use these legacy plug-ins on the Mac.\n\nFor more information on support and download locations, go to\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_mac_en or\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_win_en.\n\nOther Optional plug-ins:\n\n   •   Firewire and FirewireDLL are supported only on 32-bit systems for Mac & Win.\n   •   TWAIN for 32-bit Macintosh and Windows systems (see below for more information)\n\nPlug-ins, extensions and filters not installed in Photoshop CS5 (normally found in\nGoodies folder in versions prior to Photoshop CS4)\n\n   •   Bigger Tiles has been removed from Photoshop CS5 as the functionality has now been built\n       into the performance preferences. This can now be set in the UI by setting "Cache Tile Size"\n       to 1024K or 1028K in the performance section of Photoshop preferences.\n   •   Filmstrip format (plug-in) for 32-bit/64-bit Macintosh and Windows systems has been\n       removed from the install. In addition, it is no longer available to download.\n\nSave for Web\n\n   •   If you try to save named slices to a directory where that filename already exists, Photoshop\n       will fail to prompt you with an overwrite warning. You will silently overwrite the existing\n       file.\n   •   We have removed the shortcut used to delete the preference file for Save for Web in\n       Photoshop CS5. To manually delete this preference file, navigate to the following locations\n       and delete the Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Preferences file:\n       Windows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Application Data\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Windows Vista or Windows 7: C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Macintosh: Volume\\username\\Library\\Preferences\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n\nTool Presets\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 can read tool presets created by earlier versions of Photoshop, but earlier\n       versions of Photoshop cannot read tool presets created by Photoshop CS5.\n\n                                                 8\n\fType\n\n  •    If you are using the NVIDIA GeForce 7300GT, you may experience performance issues\n       when editing text, especially on large documents. We recommend that you upgrade your\n       video card for a better experience. For more information on this card and support options,\n       please refer to the GPU guidance document located at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n       This card is extremely problematic for many areas in Photoshop and we suggest you contact\n       the manufacturer for more information if needed.\n  •    The Japanese text input mode Koteoeri/ATOK is not supported on Mac OS 10.5.x and\n       earlier. You may experience slowdowns and lack of response when attempting to use this\n       input method. Please contact Apple support if you would like more information on this. We\n       recommend that you upgrade to Mac OS 10.6 to resolve this issue.\n  •    The legacy shortcut to duplicate and transform (Cmd + Opt + T) on Mac 10.5 now opens the\n       Character panel.\n\nTWAIN support\n\n  •    Photoshop does not install the TWAIN plug-in for Photoshop CS5. For information on\n       TWAIN support and download, refer to go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us or contact\n       the manufacturer of your device for further TWAIN support. The download package will\n       contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me for Photoshop CS5. Do not use\n       the TWAIN plug-in from Photoshop CS4 downloads.\n  •    64-bit Support: 64-bit TWAIN scanners are not officially supported in either 64-bit or 32-bit\n       Photoshop. Use at your own risk. However we have found that the Canon PIXMA MP990\n       (64-bit) works well on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Mac OS 10.6. If you need to use a\n       TWAIN scanner, we recommend that you use this scanner and upgrade to Mac OS 10.6.\n\nPHOTOSHOP CS5 EXTENDED KNOWN ISSUES\n\n3D General\n\n  •    The Nvidia GeForce 7300GT is a problematic card, especially for 3D in Photoshop on\n       Macintosh OS < 10.6. You may experience frequent crashes as well as limited functionality.\n       We recommend that you upgrade your Macintosh systems to 10.6 for a better experience.\n  •    Adobe Repoussé is dependant on OpenGL; you must have a OpenGL supported card. See\n       go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_83117_en-us for a list of supported cards and troubleshooting\n       tips.\n  •    3D objects imported (OBJ and KMZ) with missing textures may need to have their Opacity\n       manually changed to 100%. Many applications will export objects with Opacity set to 0%\n       and therefore Photoshop reads this material as fully transparent.\n  •    When creating holes using Adobe Repoussé from type layers, you may experience missing\n       geometry on the front face of the mesh if the font size is too small relative to the hole.\n  •    Image Based Lights do not have a specular component; gloss and shine maps will not have\n       any effect.\n\nCollada DAE/KMZ file format\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fDAE/KMZ mesh/model pieces may show up in the wrong place. This is because we do not create\nmeshes for polygon types like Lines and Points. In addition, because the mesh hierarchy is not\naccurate, transformations may not be in the right place. Unfortunately, as we do not support lines\nand points in our renderer, we currently have no way to resolve this issue.\n\nGoogle Warehouse 3D files (Collada) from Sketch-up 7.1\n\nGoogle Sketchup 7.1 changed the way they export their Collada format. If you have a Google 3D\nCollada file (DAE/KMZ) where it opens with missing meshes or textures, the file needs to be re-\nexported from Sketchup 7.1 or later with the Export parameter "Preserve Component hierarchies"\nunchecked.\n\nPoser 3D Collada files\n\nModels exported from Poser will often come into Photoshop with Opacity of textures set to 0%. To\nview these textures, simply change Opacity to 100% for all textures.\n\nCustomer care\nCustomer Service\n\nAdobe Customer Service provides assistance with product information, sales, registration, and other\nnon-technical issues.

22	RARE DISEASES TALKING POINTS	                                        RARE DISEASES TALKING POINTS\n               Background: 1-5\n                   • Nearly 1 in 10 Americans (estimated to be 25-30 million people) have been diagnosed with a\n                     rare disease and almost half of these are children.\n                         o Thirty-five percent of deaths that occur in the first year of life are due to rare diseases\n                         o 30% of children affected by rare diseases don’t live to their 5th birthday1,5\n                 • In the US, a rare disease is a disease impacting fewer than 200,000 patients. Sometimes only a\n                     few hundred people are known to have a specific rare disease.1\n                         o Examples of rare diseases include sickle-cell anemia, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease), cystic\n                             fibrosis, muscular dystrophies and Huntington’s Disease 2-4\n                         o Rarity of these diseases means that people may be isolated and unable to receive\n                             support from others with the same disease3\n               Challenges: 3,5-9\n               Knowledge Gap: 6\n                   • Health care providers may be less familiar with rare diseases and their symptoms than they are\n                       with more prevalent diseases like asthma and diabetes.\n                   • A recent survey (in 2014) of 1600 physicians, nurse practitioners and physicians assistants found\n                       that nearly 90 percent agree they need more information on rare diseases.6\n               Need for complex care: 3,7\n                   • People with rare diseases have complex health conditions that may involve chronic illness and\n                       disability.7\n                   • At the same time, these individuals are at an ongoing disadvantage given lack of knowledge,\n                       resources and treatment options across a range of medical conditions.\n                   • Lack of knowledge and information about a rare disease can lead to delays in accurate diagnosis\n                       or even misdiagnoses.\n                           o 1/3 of persons with a rare disease may wait as long as 5 years for their diagnosis3\n                           o Travel over long distances may be necessary to receive care from specialists who are\n                                knowledgeable about their disease3\n               Lack of treatments: 8,9\n                   • Rare diseases are complex conditions and often have limited or no treatments.8\n                   • Historically there was little incentive to invest in discovering and developing treatments for\n                       these diseases.\n                           o The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 helped to inspire a greater focus on development of\n                                treatments for rare diseases, but still only five percent of the estimated 7,000 rare\n                                diseases/disorders have an FDA-approved treatment.9\n                           o Today, there are more than 450 medicines in development for rare diseases. 9\n\n\n\n\n               THIS DOCUMENT IS CONFIDENTIAL AND NOT TO BE DUPLICATED OR DISSEMINATED.\n\n\n\n124   Version 2 2/2017\n\f               References:\n                   1.

Certain rare\n         diseases may only impact a few hundred people. The rarity of these diseases means that some\n         people may be isolated and unable to receive support from others with the same disease.\n    •    Nearly 1 in 10 Americans have been diagnosed with a rare disease. Almost half of these individuals\n         are children, 30% of whom don’t live to see their 5th birthday. 35% of deaths that occur in the first\n         year of a child’s life are due to rare diseases.\n    •    Commonly known rare diseases include: sickle-cell anemia, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease), cystic\n         fibrosis, muscular dystrophies, and Huntington’s Disease.\n\nRare diseases are often subject to a large knowledge gap. Health care providers may be less familiar with\nrare diseases and their symptoms than with more common diseases. In a 2014 survey of 1,600 physicians and\nnurses, 90% agreed that they need more information on rare diseases.\n\nPeople with rare diseases are more likely to need complex, multi-layered care. Rare diseases are more\nlikely to cause a chronic illness or disability. At the same time, these individuals are at an ongoing\ndisadvantage given lack of knowledge, which can lead to delays in accurate diagnoses.\n\nRare diseases often have limited or no treatments. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 helped to inspire a\ngreater focus on development of treatments for rare diseases, but still only five percent of the estimated\n7,000 rare diseases/disorders have an FDA-approved treatment. Today, there are more than 450 medicines in\ndevelopment for rare diseases.\n\nThe Rare Disease Commission:\n    •   Made up of 15 members total. 11 appointed by the Governor, and one member of each chamber of\n        the General Assembly. Rare disease advocacy groups will make nominations to the Governor. 5\n        members must either be patients with a rare disease or family members.\n    •   The Commission will issue a yearly report. The Commission will provide recommendations to the\n        Governor and the General Assembly on the use of innovative drugs and therapies, legislation that\n        could improve the lives of patients with rare diseases, and screening of newborns for the presence of\n        genetic disorders.\n\n\n            Support HB 4576 to encourage research, treatment, and\n                         screening for rare diseases.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f             May 9, 2016\n                                                                                         Tim Boyd\n                                                                                         202-545-3830\n                                                                                         tboyd@rarediseases.org\n             Senator John Mulroe, Chairman\n             Public Health Committee\n             127 Capitol Building\n             Springfield, IL 62706\n\n             Re: Community Support for HB 4576 (Rare Disease Commission)\n\n             Dear Chairman Mulroe and Members of the Public Health Committee:\n\n             We, the undersigned rare disease patient organizations and advocates, on behalf of the 30\n             million Americans with one of the nearly 7,000 known rare diseases, urge the committee\n             to pass HR 4576, an act creating the Illinois Rare Disease Commission.\n\n             As the voice for the rare disease community in Illinois, we are dedicated to helping\n             people with rare “orphan” diseases and assisting the organizations that serve them. Any\n             disease affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans is considered rare. With nearly 7,000\n             rare diseases identified and 30 million Americans affected, it is estimated that nearly 1 in\n             10 residents of Illinois is living with a rare disease.\n\n             Supporting the medical needs of the rare disease community is about more than just\n             accurate and timely screening. The Illinois Rare Disease Commission would give rare\n             diseases patients a voice in our state government and provide educational resources for\n             elected leaders on critical issues related to access, coverage, and the diseases themselves.\n             From providing information on the healthcare provider‐patient relationship to access\n             issues to vital life‐saving medications and therapies, the Commission will work as a\n             partner with legislative and administration leaders.\n\n             We hope you consider the incredible support that an Illinois Rare Disease Commission\n             could provide for our rare disease community. Please join us in giving a voice to\n             Illinoisans living with rare diseases – many of whom are too young or too sick to speak\n             for themselves – by supporting HB 4576.\n\n             Sincerely,\n\n             Amyloidosis Support Groups Inc.\n             Cicatricial Alopecia Research Foundation (CARF)\n\n             Cornella de Lange Syndrome Foundation\n\n             Cystic Fibrosis Research, Inc.\n\n             Cystinosis Research Network\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f             EveryLife Foundation for Rare Diseases\n             National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias (NFED)\n\n             National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n             Neurofibromatosis Network\n\n             PKU Organization of Illinois\n\n             United Leukodystrophy Foundation\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	Illinois_Rare_Disease_Commission.pdf	PDF	12	42	f	2017-08-11 04:06:56.524205	2017-08-21 07:03:10.778513	t	378500	1	370 KB

In addition to any other provisions the agency may deem\n38      necessary, the contract must require:\n39                 (c) Access.—\n40       1. The agency shall establish specific standards for the\n41number, type, and regional distribution of providers in managed\n42       care plan networks to ensure access to care for both adults and\n43       children. Each plan must maintain a regionwide network of\n44       providers in sufficient numbers to meet the access standards for\n45       specific medical services for all recipients enrolled in the\n46       plan. The exclusive use of mail-order pharmacies may not be\n47       sufficient to meet network access standards. Consistent with the\n48       standards established by the agency, provider networks may\n49       include providers located outside the region. A plan may\n50       contract with a new hospital facility before the date the\n51       hospital becomes operational if the hospital has commenced\n52       construction, will be licensed and operational by January 1,\n53       2013, and a final order has issued in any civil or\n54       administrative challenge.

Each managed care plan must publish any prescribed\n67       drug formulary or preferred drug list on the plan’s website in a\n68       manner that is accessible to and searchable by enrollees and\n69       providers. The plan must update the list within 24 hours after\n70       making a change. Each plan must ensure that the prior\n71       authorization process for prescribed drugs is readily accessible\n72       to health care providers, including posting appropriate contact\n73       information on its website and providing timely responses to\n74       providers. For Medicaid recipients diagnosed with hemophilia who\n75       have been prescribed anti-hemophilic-factor replacement\n76       products, the agency shall provide for those products and\n77       hemophilia overlay services through the agency’s hemophilia\n78       disease management program.\n79                 b. If a managed care plan restricts the use of prescribed\n80       drugs through a fail-first protocol, it must establish a clear\n81       and convenient process that a prescribing physician may use to\n82       request an override of the restriction from the managed care\n83       plan. The managed care plan shall grant an override of the\n84       protocol within 24 hours if:\n\n85       (I)       Based on sound clinical evidence, the prescribing   provider\n\n86       concludes that the preferred treatment required under         the fail-\n\n87       first protocol has been ineffective in the treatment of          the\n         enrollee’s disease or medical condition; or\n88\n89                 (II) Based on sound clinical evidence or medical and\n90       scientific evidence, the prescribing provider believes that the\n                                         Page 3 of 8\n     CODING: Words stricken are deletions; words underlined are additions.\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f         Florida Senate - 2016                                          SB 1084\n\n\n\n\n         1-00098B-16                                                 20161084\n 91      preferred treatment required under the fail-first protocol:\n 92                (A) Is likely to be ineffective given the known relevant\n 93      physical or mental characteristics and medical history of the\n 94      enrollee and the known characteristics of the drug regimen;\n 95                (B) Will cause or is likely to cause an adverse\n                   reaction                                               or\n 96\n 97      other physical harm to the enrollee.\n 98\n 99      If the prescribing provider follows the fail-first protocol\n100      recommended by the managed care plan for an enrollee, the\n\n101      duration of treatment under the fail-first protocol may not\n\n102      exceed a period deemed appropriate by the prescribing provider.\n\n103      Following such period, if the prescribing provider deems the\n         treatment provided under the protocol clinically ineffective,\n104\n         the enrollee is entitled to receive the course of therapy that\n105\n         the prescribing provider recommends, and the provider is not\n106\n         required to seek approval of an override of the fail-first\n107\n         protocol. As used in this subparagraph, the term “fail-first\n108\n         protocol” means a prescription practice that begins medication\n109\n         for a medical condition with the most cost-effective drug\n110\n         therapy and progresses to other more costly or risky therapies\n111\n         only if necessary.\n112\n              3. Managed care plans, and their fiscal agents or\n113\n         intermediaries, must accept prior authorization requests for any\n114\n         service electronically.\n\n115       4.Managed care plans serving children in the care and\n116 custody of the Department of Children and Families shall must\n117 maintain complete medical, dental, and behavioral health encounter\n118 information and participate in making such information\n119      available to the department or the applicable contracted\n                                        Page 4 of 8\n      CODING: Words stricken are deletions; words underlined are additions.\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f         Florida Senate - 2016                                           SB 1084\n\n\n\n\n         1-00098B-16                                                   20161084\n120      community-based care lead agency for use in providing\n121      comprehensive and coordinated case management. The agency and\n122      the department shall establish an interagency agreement to\n123      provide guidance for the format, confidentiality, recipient,\n124      scope, and method of information to be made available and the\n125      deadlines for submission of the data. The scope of information\n126      available to the department are shall be the data that managed\n127      care plans are required to submit to the agency. The agency\n128      shall determine the plan’s compliance with standards for access\n129      to medical, dental, and behavioral health services; the use of\n130      medications; and followup on all medically necessary services\n131      recommended as a result of early and periodic screening,\n132      diagnosis, and treatment.\n\n133                Section 3.

The insurer shall grant an override of the protocol\n139\n         within 24 hours if:\n140\n         (1)       Based on sound clinical evidence, the prescribing   provider\n141\n         concludes that the preferred treatment required under\n142\n         the fail-first protocol has been ineffective in the treatment of\n143\n         the insured’s disease or medical condition; or\n144\n              (2) Based on sound clinical evidence or medical and\n145\n         scientific evidence, the prescribing provider believes that the\n146\n         preferred treatment required under the fail-first protocol:\n147\n148                (a) Is likely to be ineffective given the known relevant\n                                         Page 5 of 8\n      CODING: Words stricken are deletions; words underlined are additions.\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f         Florida Senate - 2016                                          SB 1084\n\n\n\n\n        1-00098B-16                                                  20161084\n149     physical or mental characteristics and medical history of the\n150     insured and the known characteristics of the drug regimen; or\n151                (b) Will cause or is likely to cause an adverse reaction or\n152     other physical harm to the insured.\n153\n154      If the prescribing provider follows the fail-first protocol\n155      recommended by the insurer for an insured, the duration of\n156      treatment under the fail-first protocol may not exceed a period\n157      deemed appropriate by the prescribing provider. Following such\n158      period, if the prescribing provider deems the treatment provided\n159      under the protocol clinically ineffective, the insured is\n160      entitled to receive the course of therapy that the prescribing\n161      provider recommends, and the provider is not required to seek\n162      approval of an override of the fail-first protocol. As used in\n163      this section, the term “fail-first protocol” means a\n\n164      prescription practice that begins medication for a medical\n\n165      condition with the most cost-effective drug therapy and\n\n166      progresses to other more costly or risky therapies only if\n         necessary.\n167\n168                Section 4.

35	NORD Rare Disease Advisory Council Model Language	                National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)\n\n                                 Model Legislation:\n                      Statewide Rare Disease Advisory Council\n\n                  AN ACT establishing a State-wide Rare Disease Advisory Council\n\n\n  BE IT ENACTED:\n\nSECTION 1. Findings. The legislature finds and declares:\n\n\n   a. A rare disease is defined as a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 people. Rare\n      diseases are sometimes called orphan diseases. There are 7,000 known rare diseases\n      affecting approximately 30 million men, women and children in the United States;\n   b. The exact cause for many rare diseases remains unknown. However, 80% of rare\n      diseases are genetic in origin and can be linked to mutations in a single gene or in\n      multiple genes. Such diseases are referred to as genetic diseases. Genetic disease can\n      be passed down from generation to generation, explaining why certain rare diseases\n      run in families. It is also estimated that about half of all rare diseases affect children;\n   c. A person suffering with a rare disease in the [Your State] faces a wide range of\n      challenges, including, but not limited to: delays in obtaining a diagnosis; misdiagnosis;\n      shortage of medical specialists familiar with, and can provide treatment for, rare\n      diseases; prohibitive cost of treatment; and the inability to access therapies and\n      medication that are used by doctors to treat rare diseases but have not been approved\n      by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that specific purpose;\n   d. In recent years, researchers have made considerable progress in developing diagnostic\n      tools and treatment protocols for, and in discovering ways to prevent a variety of, rare\n      diseases. However, much more remains to be done in the areas of rare disease research\n      and the search for and development of new therapeutics; and\n   e. It is, therefore, an appropriate public policy for [Your State] to establish an advisory\n      body, whose membership would be comprised of persons with suitable qualifications\n      for this purpose, including persons living with rare diseases, to educate medical\n      professionals, government agencies, and the public about rare diseases as an important\n      public health issue, and to encourage and fund research in the development of new\n        treatments for rare diseases.\n\n\n   Version 2 2/2017\n\fSECTION 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF A RARE DISEASE ADVISORY COUNCIL\n\nThere is established the [Your State] Rare Disease Advisory Council in [Your State\nDepartment of Health].\n\n\na. The advisory council shall consist of members as follows:\n(1) Directors, or ex officio members, of [Your State Department of Health] and other state agencies concerned with the\nprovision of care to persons with rare diseases; and\n(2) Public members to be appointed by the Director of the State Department of\nHealth, who shall include:\n\ni. two physicians licensed to practice in [Your State] who have expertise in treating patients with rare diseases, one of\nwhom shall be a pediatrician who provides care to children with rare diseases;\nii. a registered professional nurse licensed in [Your State] who has expertise in providing care to patients with rare\ndiseases;\niii. two representatives of hospitals in [Your State];\niv. a representative of the health insurance industry;\nv. a representative of the biopharmaceutical industry;\nvi. a representative of the scientific community who is engaged in rare disease research;\nvii. two parents of a child with a rare disease;\nviii.two persons with a rare disease;\nix. two patient organizations that operate within [Your State].\n\n\n(3) Upon or after the Advisory Council is first convened, the council may advise [Your State Department of Health] on\nadditional at-large appointments to the council that may be necessary to carry out its duties. At-large appointments to\nthe council may serve on an ad-hoc basis.\n\nb. Vacancies in the membership of the Advisory Council shall be filled in the same manner provided for the original\nappointments. The public members of the Council shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for travel\nand other miscellaneous expenses necessary to perform their duties within the limits of funds made available to the\nCouncil for its purposes.\nc. The council shall organize as soon as practicable after the appointment of its members and shall select a chairperson\nand vice-chairperson from among its members. The chairperson shall appoint a secretary who need not be a member of\nthe council.\nd. The council shall meet periodically, but at least 3 times annually. The council shall be entitled to call to its assistance,\nand avail itself of the services of the employees of, any State, county, or municipal department, board, bureau,\ncommission, or agency as it\nmay require and as may be available to it for its purposes.\ne. The Department of Health may provide staff services to the advisory council.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\fSECTION 3. Purpose and duties.\n\na.                 The purpose of the Council shall be to:\n(1)Coordinate statewide efforts for the study of the incidence of rare disease within [Your State] and the status\nof the rare disease community; and\n(2)Act as the advisory body on rare diseases to the Legislature and State departments, agencies, commissions,\nauthorities, and private agencies that provide services to, or are charged with the care of, persons with rare\ndiseases; and\n(3)Coordinate the performance of the council’s duties with other state rare disease advisory bodies, community-\nbased organizations, and other public and private organizations for the purpose of ensuring greater cooperation\nbetween state and federal activities regarding the research, diagnosis, and treatment of rare diseases. Federal\nagencies may include, but are not exclusive to, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA). Such coordination shall require, when appropriate:\ni. disseminating the council’s research, identified best practices, and policy recommendations; and\nii. the utilization of common research collection and dissemination procedures.\n\nb.                 The duties of the Council shall be to:\n\n(1)research and determine the most appropriate method to collect rare disease data, and such information\nconcerning these patients as the Council deems necessary and appropriate to conduct thorough and complete\nsurveys of rare disease diagnosed in [Your State], subject to all applicable privacy laws and protection.\n(2)The council shall ensure that the duties described in paragraph (1) are carried out in a manner that is\ncoordinated and interoperable with similar research being conducted at the state and federal level.\n(3)Research and identify priorities relating to the quality and cost-effectiveness of, and access to, treatment and\nservices provided to persons with rare diseases in [Your State], and develop policy recommendations on those\nissues; and\n(4)Identify best practices for rare disease care from other states and at the national level that will improve rare\ndisease care in [Your State]; and\n(5)Develop effective strategies to raise public awareness of rare diseases in\n[Your State].\n\nSECTION 4. Funding and Reporting.\n\na. Prior to appointing members of the council pursuant to Sec. 2, [Your State Department of Health] shall\nresearch and report to the legislature on existing sources of funding that may be used to finance the formation\nand operation of the council.\nb. The Advisory Council shall apply for, and accept, any grant of money from the federal government, private\nfoundations, or other sources, which may be available for programs related to rare diseases.\nc. The Council shall report to [Your State Department of Health] and to the Legislature biennially on the\nactivities of the advisory council and its findings and recommendations on issues relating to the quality and\ncost-effectiveness of, and access to treatment and services to, persons with rare diseases in [Your State].\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	Pages_from__Policy_Toolkit_V2_Q12017_FINAL-CF_Commissions___Rare_Disease_Advisory_Councils_105-108.pdf	PDF	16	57	f	2017-08-14 05:12:01.844237	2017-08-21 07:03:01.448191	t	71449	1	69.8 KB

There is already price transparency in the system through quarterly Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) filings\n    and other sources.

There are specific operational challenges with transparency bills\n      a. Price transparency bills won’t do anything to help patients, increase access, or decrease the cost of\n          researching and bringing a drug to market.\n      b. Pharmaceutical RD doesn’t follow a linear path. Clinical teams may target research with the expectation that it may\n          impact rheumatoid arthritis, then may transition to other bone disease, and possibly on to other autoimmune diseases.\n          Research frequently moves in different directions. The end result could be the imposition of new rules that could\n          inhibit research.\n      c. There is no clear direction about how other outlays should be attributed (e.g., how would supplies, phone bills,\n          electric bills be attributed on a per product basis).\n\n\n3. Vertex’s invests a significant portion of its revenue on RD investment\n       a. From 2010-2014, Vertex spent 79 percent of revenue on R&D1\n       b. From 2005-2014 (i.e., over the last ten years), Vertex spent 106 percent of revenue on R&D2\n       c. Industry-wide average percentage of sales that went to R&D (2013): 17.9%3\n\n4. “Innovative” products receive minimal public funding4\n       a. 9 percent of all drugs approved between 1988 and 2005 had a public sector patent\n               i. Public sector patents: patents that were assigned to a government agency or had government interest\n                  statements (most of which came from academic laboratories that had received government funding)\n       b. 25 percent had a patent that cited at least one public-sector patent\n       c. 41 percent had a patent that cited at least one government publication\n       d. 48 percent had a patent that cited either a public-sector patent or a government publication\n\n5. Well over half of biomedical research is funded by private industry (based on 2010 analysis of 2007 JAMA)5\n      a. Industry: 58%\n      b. NIH: 27%\n      c. State/Local Government: 5%\n      d. Non-NIH Federal: 5%\n      e. Private Not-for profit: 4%\n\n6. The Federal government recognizes (CBO Report6) the value of the current biomedical research business model\n      a. “For U.S. taxpayers, the primary benefits of publicly funded research come from the therapeutic value of drugs that\n          ultimately result from that research and the Treasury’s receipt of corporate income taxes on profits from those\n          drugs. Constraining the prices of such drugs would tend to weaken firms’ incentives to develop government-funded\n          research discoveries into new drugs...”\n      b. “Most of the costs involved in developing a new drug come not from the initial discovery research but from clinical\n          testing and regulatory approval—costs that firms tend to bear themselves.”\n\n\n1\n  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.

This effectively amounts to an import subsidy and an\nexport tax. The GOP plan would reverse this, eliminating the deduction for imported goods but also\nexempting sales of exported goods. In theory, the plan would have a neutral effect regardless of the\ntype of business and would push up the value of the dollar.\n\nTax System: Corporate income tax is currently applied to income earned both domestically and\nabroad (certain income earned abroad can be deferred indefinitely if the income remains overseas,\nand corporations are allowed a foreign tax credit for taxes paid to other countries). This is known as a\nworldwide, or resident-based tax system. The House Republican plan would change this to a territorial\n(or source-based) system, meaning that American corporations would be taxed only on income earned\nwithin the physical borders of the US. In theory, this would lead to an increase in corporate\nrepatriations and allow corporations to pay a rate in foreign countries equal to that of their competitors.\n\nRepatriation: The process of converting offshore capital back into US dollars. Corporations currently\nhave about $2-3 trillion in untaxed profits outside of the US, but many are reluctant to repatriate these\nfunds due to corporate taxes charged on repatriated funds. Currently, companies can defer taxation on\nforeign profits as long as they are declared permanently or indefinitely reinvested abroad.\n\nCorporate Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT): A parallel calculation of taxable income and tax.\nCorporations pay the higher of the regular tax or the AMT.\n\nR&D Tax Credit: A nonrefundable tax credit for expenses that improve an item’s performance or\nfunctionality, as opposed to its superficial characteristics (research in social sciences/arts do not\nqualify). Eligible expenses include wages (generally the majority of expenses eligible for the credit),\nsupplies, and other research payments to qualified entities.\n\nDomestic Manufacturing Tax Credit: Qualified activities are eligible for a deduction equal to 9% of\nthe lesser of taxable income derived from qualified production activities or taxable income. Eligible\nincome includes that derived from the production or property that was manufactured, produced, grown\nor extracted in the U.S.\n\nNet Operating Loss (NOL): A loss taken in a period where a company’s allowable tax deductions are\ngreater than its taxable income. The NOL can be carried back two years or carried forward twenty\nyears. IRS rules state that if a company has at least a 50% ownership change (e.g., being acquired),\nthe acquiring company may use only that part of the NOL in each concurrent year that is based on the\nlong-term tax-exempt bond rate multiplied by the stock of the acquired company. This limits the\nusefulness of acquiring companies simply for their NOLs.\n\nOrphan Drug Tax Credit: A nonrefundable tax credit equal to 50% of qualified clinical trial costs\nrelated to the development of designated orphan drugs. Can be carried forward up to 20 years.\n\nCapital Investment: How the depreciation of capital purchases is treated.\n\nNet Interest Expense Deductibility: Interest payments on debt can be deducted from income, which\nincentivizes companies to use debt financing.\n                                                Return to table of contents\n\n  Version 2 2/2017\n\fCORPORATE TAX TALKING POINTS\n\n• Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated is a U.S.-based company, headquartered in Massachusetts.\n  We employee about 1,600 individuals in the United States, with an additional 350 in Europe and\n  Canada. Since our founding in 1989, we have invested over $10 billion in research and\n  development (on an inflation-adjusted basis), which is more than our revenue during that same time\n  period.\n• Vertex has posted a profit only twice in its 28 year history, and its losses during that time period\n  exceed $5.3 billion. Thus while Vertex does pay a variety of taxes—including state corporate\n  income taxes, social security and Medicare taxes for employees, and unemployment insurance\n  taxes—it has not yet had sufficient income to pay federal corporate income taxes.\n• In total, we believe that Republican corporate tax proposals will have a net beneficial effect on\n  Vertex. Specifically, reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate to bring it more into line with other\n  OECD countries will allow Vertex to invest more resources into life-altering therapies for patients.\n  We also support President Trump and Speaker Ryan’s proposals to maintain some form of the\n  research and development (R&D) tax credit.\n• We remained concerned, however, about proposals to eliminate the Orphan Drug Tax Credit\n  (ODTC), which provides a credit equal to 50 percent of qualified clinical trial costs related to the\n  development of orphan drugs. The ODTC has played a key role in spurring the development of\n  treatments for rare diseases, and its elimination would likely result in a decrease in the amount of\n  R&D in the orphan drug space.\n• Similarly, we remain concerned about changing the current system that allows for the deferral of tax\n  on foreign income. There is currently a large amount of uncertainty surrounding how this provision\n  would interact with potential “border adjustments” and what effect it will have on incentivizing the\n  creation of innovative medicines.\n\n\n\n\n1. Vertex does not pay the pharma fee, so there would be no impact from repealing this. Similarly, the\n    elimination of the corporate charitable contribution deduction would likely not impact Vertex, as these\n    contributions are eligible for deduction as a business expense.\n2. http://abetterway.speaker.gov/_assets/pdf/ABetterWay-Tax-PolicyPaper.pdf;\n    http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-2016-house-republican-tax-reform-plan\n3. https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/tax-plan; http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-\n    donald-trumps-tax-plan/full; http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-donald-trump-tax-reform-\n    plan-september-2016\n4.

40	Medicaid Coverage Expert and Transparent Processes Bill Language	               Medicaid Coverage Decisions Should Incorporate\n                Transparent Processes and Expert Testimony\nIndividuals suffering from rare diseases face unique healthcare challenges. Of the more than\n7,000 identified rare diseases, only 5% have known treatments. Most patients with rare diseases\nhave few, if any, therapeutic options. Those treatments are often the only hope for these\nvulnerable patients.\nFor many rare disease patients, Medicaid coverage decisions for their therapies are often made\nthrough opaque processes and without input from experts in their respective disease state. Given\nthe complex nature of rare diseases, states should solicit expert testimony when making\ncoverage decisions about therapies for rare disease patients. Further, the process for coverage\ndecisions should be transparent, predictable, and allow for appropriate public input.\n\nTreatments for Rare Diseases are Often Complex and Require Expert Medical Care\n• Proper diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases is often time-consuming and difficult. Nearly\n  30 million Americans suffer from a rare disease. The average time to diagnosis is more than\n  7 years and patients have seen 8 doctors, on average, before a proper diagnosis\n• Treatment regimen for rare disease patients are often complex and require supervision by\n  specially-trained, expert physicians.\n\nCoverage Processes Are Opaque and Decisions are Seldom Informed by Experts\n\n• Decisions regarding Medicaid coverage for pharmaceuticals vary from state-to-state.\n• Recommendations are made by state Pharmacy & Therapeutics (P&T) Committees or Drug\n  Utilization Review (DUR) Boards.\n• Each state is different, but many do not provide an opportunity for input from clinical experts\n  regarding rare disease therapies. Many also lack clearly defined, transparent processes for\n  coverage decisions.\n• This can lead to coverage policies that are inconsistent with real-world clinical practice and\n  harmful to patients.\n\nEncourage Transparent and Open Coverage Process Informed by Expert Testimony\nFollowing the example set by several states, and based on a similar program at the FDA\n(EXPERRT Act), Congress should encourage state Medicaid coverage entities to:\n\n   • Develop an open, transparent procedure for coverage determinations;\n   • Include public, patient and manufacturer perspectives during the review process;\n   • Seek advice from relevant, expert specialists when appropriate.\n                                        Version 2 2/2017\n\f                         Transparency and Expertise Sorely Lacking Across States\n\n\n\n\nTransparent Process?

                             5\n\f1         Introduction\n          This User’s Guide describes how to use the Intel® Management and Security Status\n          application. The application’s component tabs—detailed in this document—display\n          information about a platform’s support for the following technologies: Intel® Active\n          Management Technology (Intel® AMT), Intel® Small Business Technology (Intel® SBT),\n          Intel® Standard Manageability and Intel® Anti-Theft Technology (Intel® AT). All of\n          these technologies are built upon the Intel® Management Engine (Intel® ME), a\n          feature provided within the platform hardware.\n\n          The Intel® Management and Security Status icon indicates whether Intel® Active\n          Management Technology, Intel® Small Business Technology, Intel® Standard\n          Manageability and Intel® Anti-Theft Technology are running on the platform. The icon\n          is located in the notification area. By default, each time Windows* starts, Intel®\n          Management and Security Status application starts and the notification icon is\n          displayed.\n\n          The Intel® Management and Security Status application has a separate version per\n          every Intel® AMT generation (6.x, 7.x, 8.x, 9.x etc.). The installer for 9.x also\n          supports the 8.x generation. If the Intel® Management and Security Status application\n          starts automatically as a result of the user logging on to Windows*, the icon will be\n          loaded to the notification area only if a supported combination of the following\n          technologies is present on the platform: Intel® Active Management Technology, Intel®\n          Small Business Technology, and Intel® Standard Manageability. If the Intel®\n          Management and Security Status application is started manually (via the Start menu),\n          the icon is loaded even if none of these technologies are enabled.\n\n    Note: The information displayed in the Intel® Management and Security Status application is\n          not shown in real time. The data is refreshed at predefined intervals.\n\n\n\n\n                       6\n\f2   System Requirements\n    The Intel® Management and Security Status application has the following\n    requirements:\n          OS\n               o Windows* 2003 Standard Edition R2\n               o Windows* 2003 x64 EditionWindows* XP Pro with latest SP\n               o Windows* XP x64 with latest SP\n               o Windows* 7 Ultimate 32 bit with latest SP\n               o Windows* 7 Enterprise 32 bit with latest SP\n               o Windows* 7 Professional 32 bit with latest SP\n               o Windows* 7 Ultimate 64 bit with latest SP\n               o Windows* 7 Enterprise 64 bit with latest SP\n               o Windows* 7 Professional 64 bit with latest SP\n               o Windows* 7 Premium 64-bit with latest SP\n               o Windows* 7 Home Premium 32 bit with latest SP\n               o Windows* 7 Home Basic 32 bit with latest SP\n               o Windows* 8\n               o Windows Server *2008 x86 with latest SP\n               o Windows Server *2008 x64 with latest SP\n               o Windows Server* 2012\n          Platform running Intel® Management Engine firmware\n          Intel® Management Engine software installed\n\n\n\n\n                                             §\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              7\n\f3          Using the Intel® Management\n           and Security Status Application\n           and Icon\n           Whenever either Intel® Active Management Technology, Intel® Small Business\n           Technology or Intel® Standard Manageability is enabled, Intel® Management and\n           Security Status icon is loaded into the notification area when Windows* starts. It can\n           also be started by clicking Start> All Programs\\Intel\\Intel® Management and\n           Security Status\\ Intel® Management and Security Status.\n\n           While the Intel® Management and Security Status application is running, the Intel®\n           Management and Security Status icon is visible in the notification area. This icon will\n           appear blue if any one of the aforementioned technologies is enabled on the\n           computer. In any other case, the icon will appear gray.\n\n    Note: The icon will also be gray if the Intel® Management and Security Application User\n          Notification Service is not running or the Intel® Management Engine Interface (Intel®\n          MEI) driver is disabled or unavailable.\n\n           To view the Intel® Management and Security Status application:\n              Double-click the Intel® Management and Security Status icon, or\n              Right-click or left-click the icon and choose Open, or\n              Click Start>All Programs>Intel>Intel® Management and Security Status>\n               Intel® Management and Security Status.\n\n    Note: If your computer is set to Classic Start Menu, the path will start with ‘Programs’\n          instead of ‘All Programs’.\n\n           The following sections describe the information available in the application’s tabs.\n           Information about the application is available also by clicking either the “Learn more”\n           button     or link.\n\n    Note: The application dynamically hides tabs that are not relevant. For example, on\n          platforms that do not support Intel® AT, the Intel® AT tab is hidden.\n\n\n\n\n                        8\n\f3.1       General Tab\n          The General tab provides status information about the Intel AMT, Intel SBT, Intel®\n          Standard Manageability, and Intel AT status, and events related to these technologies.\n\n\n\n\n Figure 3-1.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               9\n\fEvents and some of their details are displayed in the Event History section. These\ncan be sorted by clicking on the relevant column header.\n\nThe status of Intel® Active Management Technology, Intel® Small Business\nTechnology, Intel® Standard Manageability or Intel® Anti-Theft Technology is\ndisplayed in the Service Status section depending on which technology is operational\non the system. The tab displays information for Intel® Active Management\nTechnology, Intel® Small Business Technology, or Intel® Standard Manageability. The\nstatus can be one of the following:\n   Intel® AMT: Enabled / Disabled / Information unavailable\n       When Intel® AMT status presents Enabled it means that the Intel® AMT is\n    supported on the system. Intel® ME status (in the Advanced Tab) will give the\n    user information on whether the Intel® ME is configured (hence Intel® AMT is\n    functional and operating).\n       When Intel® AMT status presents Disabled it means that the Intel® AMT is\n    either not enabled on the system or has been disabled by the IT administrator.\n        Information unavailable: It is not known whether Intel® AMT is supported on\n    the system. No Intel® AMT information is available. This can be for one of the\n    following reasons: LMS service has stopped, or the Intel® Management Engine\n    Interface (Intel® MEI) driver is disabled.\n   Intel® SBT: Enabled / Disabled / Information unavailable\n       When Intel® SBT status presents Enabled it means that the Intel® SBT is\n    supported on the system. Intel® ME status (in the Advanced Tab) will give the\n    user information on whether the Intel® ME is configured (hence Intel® SBT is\n    functional and operating).\n       When Intel® SBT status presents Disabled it means that the Intel® SBT is\n    either not enabled on the system or has been disabled by the IT administrator.\n        Information unavailable: It is not known whether Intel® SBT is supported on\n    the system. No Intel® SBT information is available. This can be for one of the\n    following reasons: LMS service has stopped, or the Intel MEI driver is disabled.\n   Intel® Standard Manageability: Enabled / Disabled / Information unavailable\n       When Intel® Standard Manageability status presents Enabled it means that\n    the Intel® Standard Manageability technology is supported on the system. Intel®\n    ME status (in the Advanced Tab) will give the user information on whether the\n    Intel® ME is configured (hence Intel® Standard Manageability is functional and\n    operating).\n       When Intel® Standard Manageability status presents Disabled it means that\n    the Intel® Standard Manageability technology is either not enabled on the system\n    or has been disabled by the IT administrator.\n\n\n\n\n             10\n\f              Information unavailable: It is not known whether Intel® Standard\n           Manageability technology is supported on the system. No Intel® Standard\n           Manageability information is available. This can be for one of the following\n           reasons: LMS service has stopped, or the Intel MEI driver is disabled.\n          Intel® Anti-Theft Technology: Enabled. This means that the Intel® Anti-Theft\n           Technology feature is supported on the platform. If Intel® Anti-Theft Technology is\n           not supported on the platform; no reference to it is displayed. The feature\n           becomes activated only after the platform has been enrolled with an Intel® Anti-\n           Theft Technology service provider and all required configurations have been\n           applied.\n\nNote: The information in this field shows the state of the platform at the last platform boot.\n\n       Enable user notification: Checking this box allows the user to enable or disable the\n       Intel® Management and Security Status icon from displaying important notifications in\n       the notification area (for instance, notification will be sent when one of the\n       technologies is enabled or disabled). Checking or unchecking the checkbox affects the\n       Intel® Management and Security Status application setting for the current user\n       account only.\n\n       On Windows* 8 platforms, IMSS user notifications are also displayed as Windows* 8\n       UI ‘Toast’ notifications, visible to users working with the Windows* 8 UI. These\n       notifications will only be displayed as long as a Windows* 8 UI Start Menu shortcut\n       (Windows* 8 UI ‘tile’) is present.\n\n       Intel® Management and Security Status application will be available next\n       time I log on to Windows*: Checking this box causes the Intel® Management and\n       Security Status application to be invoked, and the icon to be displayed, whenever you\n       log on to Windows*. Checking or unchecking the checkbox affects Intel® Management\n       and Security Status application’s behavior for the current user account only.\n\nNote: The application does not load automatically with Windows* log-on if none of the\n      technologies it displays (Intel® Active Management Technology, Intel® Small Business\n      Technology or Intel® Standard Manageability) are supported on the platform. Intel®\n      Management and Security Status application will load automatically even if all of the\n      technologies are disabled, so long as they are supported. Intel ® Management and\n      Security Status application will not load if these technologies are not supported in the\n      platform.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             11\n\f3.2          Intel® Active Management Technology Tab\n      Note: This tab is displayed only if the platform supports Intel® AMT.\n\n             Click the Intel® AMT tab to display Intel® AMT information.\n\n\n\n\n Figure 3-2.\n\n\n\n\n                          12\n\f3.2.1     Fast Call for Help\n          The Fast Call for Help section provides Client Initiated Local Access (CILA) or Client\n          Initiated Remote Access (CIRA) capabilities depending on whether the system is\n          connected to the corporate network or not, respectively. The Fast Call for Help section\n          will be available for the CIRA/CILA use-cases, providing the proper configuration for\n          CIRA/CILA has been done, as well as for a case in which the user’s system did not\n          receive an IP address while the wireless network is available for a support session to\n          take place. Otherwise, the Fast Call for Help section will be grayed out.\n\n          CIRA allows a user to connect the Intel® AMT system to the company’s Information\n          Technology network from an external internet connection. Click the “Get Technical\n          Help” button to connect to your Information Technology network for system\n          diagnostics and maintenance. The current connection status is displayed in this\n          section as well.\n\n          CILA (Client Initiated Local Access) feature allows a user connected to the internal\n          corporate network to send a support request to the IT administrator.\n\n    Note: In order for CIRA/CILA to work, the machine needs to be configured correctly, and\n          support this technology. Such settings are typically done by management software.\n          (Configuration details appear in the Intel® AMT SDK Implementation and Reference\n          Guide).\n\n    Note: The information displayed in the Intel® Management and Security Status application,\n          including the Fast Call for Help section, is not shown in real time. The data is\n          refreshed every time an event has arrived.\n\n    Note: When the user is connected as Guest account (in Windows*) the “Fast Call For Help”\n          section will be grayed out. This was designed to prevent users outside of the\n          organization to influence the organization network.\n\n\n3.2.2     Support Session Status\n          The following information is provided:\n              KVM Remote Control Connection\n\n              Indicates whether KVM (Keyboard, Video & Mouse) Remote Control session is open.\n              Possible values: Connected/ Disconnected/ Information unavailable.\n              The “KVM Remote Control Connection” section will be grayed out if the KVM Remote\n              Control feature is disabled on the system.\n              Media Redirection\n\n              Indicates whether there are any open IDE redirection sessions.\n              Possible values: Connected/ Disconnected/ Information unavailable.\n              Terminal and Keyboard Redirection\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 13\n\f          Indicates whether there are any open terminal/keyboard redirection sessions.\n          Possible values: Connected/ Disconnected/ Information unavailable.\n\n\n\n          Stop Sessions\n\n          Click the “Stop Sessions” button to close any open KVM Remote Control, media\n          redirection, or terminal/keyboard redirection sessions. In cases when user consent\n          is required for such a session, re-establishing the session will require renewal of\n          user consent after clicking this button.\n          Hot Key\n\n          Indicates the hot key which could be used to close any open KVM Remote Control,\n          media redirection, or terminal/keyboard redirection sessions (same effect as “Stop\n          Sessions” button).\n\n          Click on the “Change” button to choose a different hot key for terminating an open\n          session.\n          Prevent Access\n\n          This button will appear in cases where user consent is required for a remote support\n          session to occur. In such cases, after the user will provide the required approval to\n          the remote administrator and as long as the healing session hasn’t begun, the user\n          will see the “Prevent Access” button. This button enables the user to change his/her\n          mind, as clicking on it will cancel user consent and disable the ability of the IT\n          administrator to begin the remote session. During this time, the Hot Key will also\n          serve as a means to cancel user consent.

Expected behavior is for WLAN control to be the\n            same as WLAN preference. However, if for some reason the operating system fails\n            to take control over the wireless network (e.g. the wireless driver is dysfunctional),\n            the user will witness WLAN preference given to the operating system while WLAN\n            control is with Intel® ME (even if the Return Control button was clicked).\n            Possible values are: Operating System/ Intel® ME. This control is not shown on\n            platforms from Intel ME 8.1 onwards.\n\n\n3.6.5   Extended System Details\n        When clicking Extended System Details, a Windows* System Information window will\n        open, providing an extensive report about system components and configuration.\n\n        The report includes both general information regarding the system (“Host\n        Information”) and specific Intel® Management Engine Information (“Intel® ME\n        Information”).\n\n        It is possible to save the system report to a file by clicking File->Export on the System\n        Information Window.\n\n        Below are explanations for some of the details displayed under Intel® ME Information:\n\n        Host information:\n            Operating System Name – The Windows* operating system that the application is\n             running on.\n            Operating System Version – The version of the operating system.\n            System Manufacturer – The hardware manufacturer.\n            System Name – The computer name as recognized by the operating system.\n            System Model – The hardware platform name.\n            Processor – The processor full brand name.\n\n\n                       26\n\f   BIOS Version – The BIOS manufacturer name and BIOS version number.\n   LAN Driver – The version number of the LAN device driver.\n   LAN DeviceID – The PCI Device ID for the LAN device.\n   WLAN Driver - The version number of the Wireless LAN device driver.\n   WLAN DeviceID – The PCI Device ID for the Wireless LAN device.\n\n\n\nIntel® ME Information:\n   Intel ME Control Mode – The configuration mode (Client Control or Admin Control).\n   Provisioning Mode – State of Intel ME configuration (Pre/In/Post).\n   BIOS boot – The BIOS boot state (expected to be Post Boot).\n   Last Intel ME reset reason - The reason that the Intel® ME was last reset (Global\n    System/ FW reset / Power Up/ Unknown cause/ Information unavailable).\n   System UUID – The Universal Unique Identifier of the computer.

55	Watch: Medicaid Strategies	                                              Watch: Medicaid Strategies\n\n         Background\n         While Medicaid agencies and Managed Care Organizations (“MCOs”) have taken some actions\n         that currently threaten Medicaid patient access to CF drugs, in other areas there is a potential\n         for such problems, but no widespread access issues reported to date. The best approach for\n         now is to monitor these issues. If changes occur that call patient access to CF drugs into\n         question, a more proactive position may be more appropriate.\n\n         These issues to watch relate to providers who prescribe Vertex products. If managed care\n         networks limit access to cystic fibrosis centers and other CF specialists that prescribe CF drugs,\n         then patients who need Vertex products may not receive the needed prescriptions. Recent\n         reports by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General have\n         found that states often fail to properly monitor provider access in Medicaid MCO networks and\n         that many network providers fail to offer appointments. New Medicaid managed care\n         regulations expected this year may impose new access standards.\n\n\n         Network Adequacy\n             •     Vertex’s Position: MCO networks should provide access to rare disease specialists,\n                   including cystic fibrosis centers, that is sufficient to allow CF patients to obtain needed\n                   care from CF experts.\n             •     State Example(s): New Jersey’s Medicaid MCO contract requires MCOs to provide access\n                   to specialty centers both in and out of the state for the treatment of rare disorders and\n                   to include within their networks “Centers of Excellence” for children with special health\n                   care needs. New York’s Medicaid MCO contract requires MCOs to have an adequate\n                   network of pediatric sub-specialists for children with special health care needs and to\n                   make arrangements for assuring access to specialty centers in and out of the state for\n                   treatment of rare disorders.\n             •     Strategic Pathway: States can impose network adequacy requirements on MCOs\n                   through MCO contractual provisions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            1\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	Watch-_Medicaid_Strategies_283.pdf	PDF	13	77	f	2017-08-14 05:24:50.101608	2017-08-21 07:03:05.697056	t	120943	1	118 KB

101	Talking Points: Price Transparency	                            GAPP REACTIVE TALKING POINTS ON PRICE TRANSPARENCY\n1. There is already price transparency in the system through quarterly Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) filings\n    and other sources. Information contained in SEC filings represents what regulators and industry think is feasible in\n    terms of reporting. The absence of certain information may indicate the limited utility of such information or the\n    difficulty in providing accurate, meaningful numbers.\n\n       Issue                                  Current Reporting                                         Comments\n1.

There are specific operational challenges with transparency bills\n      a. Price transparency bills won’t do anything to help patients, increase access, or decrease the cost of\n          researching and bringing a drug to market.\n      b. Pharmaceutical RD doesn’t follow a linear path. Clinical teams may target research with the expectation that it may\n          impact rheumatoid arthritis, then may transition to other bone disease, and possibly on to other autoimmune diseases.\n          Research frequently moves in different directions. The end result could be the imposition of new rules that could\n          inhibit research.\n      c. There is no clear direction about how other outlays should be attributed (e.g., how would supplies, phone bills,\n          electric bills be attributed on a per product basis).\n\n\n3. Vertex’s invests a significant portion of its revenue on RD investment\n       a. From 2010-2014, Vertex spent 79 percent of revenue on R&D1\n       b. From 2005-2014 (i.e., over the last ten years), Vertex spent 106 percent of revenue on R&D2\n       c. Industry-wide average percentage of sales that went to R&D (2013): 17.9%3\n\n4. “Innovative” products receive minimal public funding4\n       a. 9 percent of all drugs approved between 1988 and 2005 had a public sector patent\n               i. Public sector patents: patents that were assigned to a government agency or had government interest\n                  statements (most of which came from academic laboratories that had received government funding)\n       b. 25 percent had a patent that cited at least one public-sector patent\n       c. 41 percent had a patent that cited at least one government publication\n       d. 48 percent had a patent that cited either a public-sector patent or a government publication\n\n5. Well over half of biomedical research is funded by private industry (based on 2010 analysis of 2007 JAMA)5\n      a. Industry: 58%\n      b. NIH: 27%\n      c. State/Local Government: 5%\n      d.

The Federal government recognizes (CBO Report6) the value of the current biomedical research business model\n      a. “For U.S. taxpayers, the primary benefits of publicly funded research come from the therapeutic value of drugs that\n          ultimately result from that research and the Treasury’s receipt of corporate income taxes on profits from those\n          drugs.

102	Talking Points: Vertex Drug Pipeline	    The Science of Possibility—Investigational Medicines in\n    the Vertex Pipeline\n    Vertex is a global biotechnology company that aims to discover, develop, and commercialize innovative medicines. Vertex\n    works with leading researchers, doctors, and other collaborators to help people with serious diseases, their families and\n    society. In addition to clinical development programs focused on cystic fibrosis (CF), Vertex has more than a dozen ongoing\n    research programs aimed at other serious and life-threatening diseases.1,2\n\n    Understanding of the science of cystic fibrosis (CF) is driving Vertex to discover and develop investigational medicines\n    that may treat the vast majority of people with CF in the coming years. While we have come a long way, there is more\n    work to be done—two out of three people with CF in the US do not yet have a medicine that treats the underlying\n    cause of their disease.2\n         •    Four Phase 3 studies of the investigational combination of VX-661 and ivacaftor are ongoing in different groups\n              of people with CF who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation.3\n         •    Two investigational next-generation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) correctors, VX-\n              152 and VX-440, are in clinical development. Vertex hopes these clinical studies will contribute to the\n              development of future combination regimens. This is an important part of our strategy to potentially provide\n              additional benefits to patients not helped by KALYDECO® (ivacaftor) or ORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) today.2,4\n         •    Vertex is collaborating with Parion Sciences to develop the investigational epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)\n              inhibitor VX-371 as a potential treatment for all people with CF regardless of CFTR mutation. Parion is currently\n              conducting an exploratory Phase 2a study of inhaled VX-371. Vertex plans to conduct a phase 2a study in the first\n              quarter of 2016 to evaluate VX-371 in patients who have two copies of the F508del mutation and are taking\n              ORKAMBI®. 2,5\n\n\n\n\n    In October 2015, Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics announced a strategic research collaboration to explore the use of the\n    gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to discover and develop potential new treatments to correct the\n    underlying genetic causes of human diseases. The initial focus of this collaborative research will be the genetic mutations\n    that cause CF and sickle cell disease. This collaboration continues the emphasis on innovative science which has been a\n    part of Vertex since its founding in 1989.6\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f    The Science of Possibility—Investigational Medicines in the Vertex Pipeline\n\n\n    Vertex has research and development programs focused on the treatment of key mechanisms that are\n    part of multiple serious diseases.2,7\n    Several investigational medicines are currently in clinical development for diseases other than CF.\n    These investigational compounds include:\n       • In addition to the ongoing and planned Phase 2 studies of VX-371 in CF, Vertex and Parion\n            plan to begin the first study of VX-371 in people with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in\n            the second half of 2016.2\n       • VX-970, VX-803 and VX-984 which are compounds designed to inhibit DNA repair pathways\n            fundamental to the survival and proliferation of certain cancers. These investigational\n            medicines were discovered by Vertex scientists and may be applicable to the treatment of\n            multiple tumor types. VX- 970 is the most advanced drug candidate in oncology with two on-\n            going clinical studies. VX-803 and VX-984 are in Phase 1 of clinical studies. 2,7\n       • VX-150 and VX-241 are two investigational medicines designed to inhibit sodium channels\n            involved in pain sensation. VX-150 is designed to block pain signaling through inhibition of a\n            sodium channel known as NaV 1.8. Vertex recently entered a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical\n            study in a small number of patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. VX-241 is an\n            inhibitor of a sodium channel known as NaV 1.7 and Vertex plans to begin clinical development\n            of this investigational compound in the first half of 2016.2\n       • Vertex is developing VX-210 as a potential medicine for acute spinal cord injury and plans a\n            Phase 2 study in the first half of 2016.2\n       • Janssen is advancing JNJ-872 (VX-787) a novel treatment for influenza discovered by\n            Vertex. As part of the agreement with Janssen, Vertex may receive development and\n            commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on future product sales.2\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f    The Science of Possibility—Investigational Medicines in the Vertex Pipeline\n\n    References:\n\n    1.VXR-US-02-01177.

103	Talking Points: Rare Diseases	                       RARE DISEASES TALKING POINTS\nBackground: 1-5\n   • Nearly 1 in 10 Americans (estimated to be 25-30 million people) have been\n       diagnosed with a rare disease and almost half of these are children.\n            o Thirty-five percent of deaths that occur in the first year of life are due to rare\n                diseases\n            o 30% of children affected by rare diseases don’t live to their 5th birthday1,5\n   • In the US, a rare disease is a disease impacting fewer than 200,000 patients.\n       Sometimes only a few hundred people are known to have a specific rare disease.1\n            o Examples of rare diseases include sickle-cell anemia, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s\n                disease), cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophies and Huntington’s Disease 2-4\n            o Rarity of these diseases means that people may be isolated and unable to\n                receive support from others with the same disease3\nChallenges: 3,5-9\nKnowledge Gap: 6\n   • Health care providers may be less familiar with rare diseases and their symptoms than\n       they are with more prevalent diseases like asthma and diabetes.\n   • A recent survey (in 2014) of 1600 physicians, nurse practitioners and physicians\n       assistants found that nearly 90 percent agree they need more information on rare\n       diseases.6\nNeed for complex care: 3,7\n   • People with rare diseases have complex health conditions that may involve chronic\n       illness and disability.7\n   • At the same time, these individuals are at an ongoing disadvantage given lack of\n       knowledge, resources and treatment options across a range of medical conditions.\n   • Lack of knowledge and information about a rare disease can lead to delays in accurate\n       diagnosis or even misdiagnoses.\n            o 1/3 of persons with a rare disease may wait as long as 5 years for their diagnosis3\n            o Travel over long distances may be necessary to receive care from specialists\n                who are knowledgeable about their disease3\nLack of treatments: 8,9\n   • Rare diseases are complex conditions and often have limited or no treatments.8\n   • Historically there was little incentive to invest in discovering and developing treatments\n       for\n       these diseases.\n            o The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 helped to inspire a greater focus on\n                development of treatments for rare diseases, but still only five percent of\n                the estimated 7,000 rare diseases/disorders have an FDA-approved\n                treatment.9\n            o Today, there are more than 450 medicines in development for rare diseases. 9\n\n\n\n\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS CONFIDENTIAL AND NOT TO BE DUPLICATED OR DISSEMINATED.\n\n\n\n                                                 Version 2 2/2017\n\fReferences:\n   1.

106	Leave Behind: Policy Positions	                     VERTEX POLICY POSITIONS\n\n\n\n\n1. Appropriate access to CF medicines\n• Payers may put in place policies that are inconsistent with the Food and Drug\n    Administration (FDA) product label, which can result in significant barriers to access\n    for patients. Payer policies for CF treatments should be consistent with the\n    indication(s) and limitation(s) for use found in the product label that has been\n    reviewed and approved by the FDA.\n• Critical medications may be completely excluded from plan formularies or placed\n    on a tier that has a high cost-sharing requirement. Patients should not be subjected\n    to discriminatory formularies and/or unreasonable out-of-pocket costs, particularly\n    if there is no other treatment option available.\n• Although drug review committees that make coverage recommendations are\n    already made up of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, they may have limited\n    experience with treating patients with rare diseases. Clinical experts should be\n    consulted to ensure appropriate criteria are established and patient needs are\n    addressed.\n 2. Modern regulatory infrastructure that promotes the development and delivery of\ninnovative medicines\n• Precision medicine is an exciting new field that shows great promise in treating a\n    wide range of serious diseases by targeting an individual’s genetics, lifestyle, and\n    environment. We support updating the FDA’s drug approval process to reflect the\n    complexities and promises of transformative precision medicines by allowing for\n    the consideration of real-world evidence and streamlining the clinical trial process.\n3. Increased awareness and education surrounding rare diseases and CF\n• Informed policymakers can help advocate on issues vital to people living with rare\n    diseases, including CF, through a variety of methods.

Medicaid plays a critical role for people with CF.1\n   The experience for patients with CF is different for those in Medicaid compared to those in commercial plans. Patients with CF\n    in Medicaid often experience a more severe course of disease: they are sicker at a young age, stay in the hospital more\n    frequently and longer, and overall have a higher utilization of expensive healthcare resources despite their younger age.2\n   Historically, patients with CF have had limited treatment options. For those within Medicaid, the risk of death has been almost\n    4x higher than for patients with CF who are not in Medicaid.3\n   New, innovative CF medicines treat the underlying cause of the disease, helping patients live healthier lives and potentially\n    avoiding costly services.4,5\n   There can be challenges accessing crucial CF medicines in a timely manner due to delays in the coverage process. Within the\n    existing Medicaid drug coverage process, there can be uncertainty and variation in (1) the time it takes for a new drug to be\n    reviewed by a payer, (2) clinical criteria qualifying a patient for coverage, and (3) participation by clinical experts.\n\n\n         Medicaid Prescription Drug Spending, 20146                                             Medicaid Spending in Context\n                       $44B Spent on Outpatient                                           In Medicaid, outpatient prescription medicines account for\n                          Prescription Drugs*                                                   approximately 9% of total spending.6,7\n                                                                                          Overall, states spend a relatively limited portion of their pharmacy\n                                1.3% Spent on CF                                                budgets on orphan diseases.

110	Vertex Precision Medicine 1-Pager	             Key Precision Medicine Policies - Energy and Commerce 21st Century Cures Draft\n      New FDA guidance needed so that companies can efficiently plan and invest in precision medicine\n\nIt is an exciting time in the science of drug discovery. DNA sequencing has given us the ability to develop medicines that treat\nthe right person at the right time with the right drug – the definition of “precision medicine.” Such targeted therapies have the\npotential to both transform lives and revolutionize the way we provide care.\n\nThe President recognized the promise of precision medicine in the State of the Union and has dedicated funds though the NIH\nto implement his Precision Medicine Initiative. While this is an important first step, the precision medicine revolution presents\na new set of challenges – challenges in which FDA must play a critical role in ensuring the successful development of these\ntargeted therapies.\n\nThere is a level of uncertainty based on the novel nature of precision medicines that result in a need to tailor the benefit-to-\nrisk calculus while reviewing these life-altering therapies. This and other factors have led to a situation where FDA is making ad-\nhoc policy decisions about clinical trial design, the role of biomarkers and surrogate endpoints, and expedited review pathways.\nWhile understandable, these processes are not conducive to the development of novel therapies and are untenable in the long-\nrun.\n\nTo help foster innovation and advance the President’s Precision Medicine Initiative, FDA should provide guidance to\nmanufacturers, researchers, and related stakeholders about the development of precision medicines. Guidance can help define\nwhat precision medicine is and how sponsors and stakeholders can generate, interpret, and extrapolate evidence in order to\nproperly design clinical trials. FDA can also help identify population subsets that could benefit from precision medicines. Finally,\nFDA should assess how the current regulatory approval process for orphan drugs, priority review, and expedited approval may\nbe applied to precision medicines.\n\nThe net result will be a predictable, efficient and flexible set of rules and expectations for stakeholders to use as they develop\nthese transformative therapies. More importantly, it will result in new and better treatment options for patients with unmet\nmedical needs. Indeed, this is the ultimate goal of precision medicine – to provide hope for Americans with currently\nuntreatable diseases.\n\nThe precision medicine guidance provision included in the second Cures draft provides suggested guideposts for FDA to\nconsider as they develop guidance, while maintaining sufficient flexibility for FDA to address additional topics. These\nsuggestions include:\n\n•   The definition of a precision drug, including basic information to assist in development of precision drugs.\n        o Definition: A drug that alone, or in combination with other therapies, targets a subset of individuals with a disease\n            that can be used to address the underlying cause of the disease in order to modify its progression, to prevent or\n            cure the disease. The population subset can be identified by genotype alone, genotype in combination with other\n            biological characteristics, or though other biologic characteristics as designated by the Secretary.\n\n•   Clarification about reliance on data from previously-submitted investigations.\n        o Understanding the biology of a disease can enable a sponsor to extrapolate efficacy data across subgroups using\n             biomarkers and other surrogate endpoints that predict clinical safety and benefit.\n\n•   How expedited approval will be applied to precision medicines.\n      o Congress has already provided FDA with the authority to support the accelerated approval of drugs in certain\n          cases where they have been established to be safe and where preliminary evidence of clinical benefit can be\n          demonstrated by surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical effect. FDA should clarify how precision medicines\n          will fit into those various expedited review pathways.\n\n•   How to identify population subsets and design clinical studies based on these subsets.\n       o Individuals with one or more genetic risk factors for a disease may be divided into subsets for the purpose of\n            identifying groups that may have favorable clinical responses to particular types of drugs. Further, there may be\n            consideration of whether there are multiple genetic risk factors or other biological characteristics that are\n            common to the disease.\n                                                                              Version 2 2/2017\n\f	Policy_Toolkit_V2_Q12017_FINAL_471.pdf	PDF	22	132	f	2017-08-14 05:56:22.717979	2017-08-21 07:03:08.770204	t	342250	1	334 KB

The award was presented to Jeffrey Leiden, Vertex’s chief executive, and Fred Van Goor, a scientist who played a key role in\ninventing Kalydeco at the Forbes Healthcare Summit in New York.\n\nThis drug is the first effective treatment for a deadly disorder (cystic fibrosis),” says Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, one of an expert panel\nconvened to pick an honoree. “Although I do not care for these children, I am well aware of the devastating effects of this disease on patients and\ntheir families.” Helping me choose, aside from Nissen: Peter Bach, of Memorial SloanKettering, who has criticized the pharmaceutical industry’s\npricing practices; Richard Evans, of SSR Research, a longtime industry analyst; Bernard Munos, a consultant who studies why it is so difficult to\ninvent new medicines. I voted, too.\n\nThe panel unanimously chose to look at a period of several years, because not every year brings a breakthrough and some bring two. And we chose\nnot to consider medicines until they had been on the market for a few years, because sometimes new drugs turn out to be either less or more\nimportant than they seem. Each panelist made his own choices, which we then discussed. We ranked the contenders based on that voting. Kalydeco\nwas the clear winner, appearing high on each judge’s list and getting a total of four stars on our rating scale.. But there were other important\nmedicines approved during this time period, too. The runners up, in descending order:\n\n*** Eliquis, from BristolMyers Squibb and Pfizer. A whole class of bloodthinning pills offer patients at high risk of blood clots or strokes\nalternatives to warfarin, the 60yearold mainstay that requires constant monitoring.\nSome data indicate they may lower the risk of stroke more than warfarin. The panel opted to pick Eliquis, which it deemed the best of these new\nblood thinners, over Pradaxa from Boehringer Ingelheim, which was the first to reach the market.\n\n** Xalkori, from Pfizer. This genetargeted cancer drug has dramatic effects in patients who have nonsmall cell lung cancer driven by particular\nsets of genetic mutations. Bach notes that it was really the first cancer drug developed to target a particular cancer driver mutation, and that a\ndiagnostic test to predict which patients would respond was ready when it was approved. It also charted a new path, getting accelerated approval\nwith a companion diagnostic just four years after the driver was identified.\n\n\n** Yervoy, from BristolMyers Squibb. Approved in 2011, Yervoy was the first new treatmet for\nmetastatic melanoma, the deadly skin cancer, in a decade. It is also the opening salvo in a series of new\ncancer medicines that work by encouraging the immune system to attack tumors.\n\n\n* Perjeta, from Roche. This drug is an heir to Herceptin, the incredibly effective breast cancer treatment. Perjeta is even more effective.\n\nOne concern that made all of the judges uneasy was the issue of price. All of these medicines are expensive, and Kalydeco is the priciest, with a list\nprice of $305,000 per patient per year. Several times, we considered making price a factor in the decision, but at the end of the day we did not factor\nit in precisely because so many of the drugs were so expensive. What should we do, pick Yervoy, which, in combination with a newer Bristol drug\ncalled Opdivo, can cost $256,000 to treat one patient for one year? In the end, drug pricing is a systemic problem.\n\nHere’s what swayed us to pick Kalydeco: it’s dramatic effect in a deadly disease that cuts people down early in life. The gene for cystic fibrosis was\ndiscovered in 1989. It took three decades for a treatment to emerge from that work, and even then it only works in a small sliver of patients. (Vertex\nhas a new treatment, Orkambi, that aims to extend this benefit to other types of CF mutations, but the results are less impressive despite a similar\ncost to Kalydeco.) That’s a major breakthrough, and represents the best that the pharmaceutical industry has to offer.\n\n                                                                         Version 2 2/2017\n\f	Policy_Toolkit_V2_Q12017_FINAL_472.pdf	PDF	22	133	f	2017-08-14 05:56:38.294118	2017-08-21 07:03:08.935059	t	278753	1	272 KB

The award was presented to Jeffrey Leiden, Vertex’s chief executive, and Fred Van Goor, a scientist who played a key role in\ninventing Kalydeco at the Forbes Healthcare Summit in New York.\n\nThis drug is the first effective treatment for a deadly disorder (cystic fibrosis),” says Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, one of an expert panel\nconvened to pick an honoree. “Although I do not care for these children, I am well aware of the devastating effects of this disease on patients and\ntheir families.” Helping me choose, aside from Nissen: Peter Bach, of Memorial SloanKettering, who has criticized the pharmaceutical industry’s\npricing practices; Richard Evans, of SSR Research, a longtime industry analyst; Bernard Munos, a consultant who studies why it is so difficult to\ninvent new medicines. I voted, too.\n\nThe panel unanimously chose to look at a period of several years, because not every year brings a breakthrough and some bring two. And we chose\nnot to consider medicines until they had been on the market for a few years, because sometimes new drugs turn out to be either less or more\nimportant than they seem. Each panelist made his own choices, which we then discussed. We ranked the contenders based on that voting. Kalydeco\nwas the clear winner, appearing high on each judge’s list and getting a total of four stars on our rating scale.. But there were other important\nmedicines approved during this time period, too. The runners up, in descending order:\n\n*** Eliquis, from BristolMyers Squibb and Pfizer. A whole class of bloodthinning pills offer patients at high risk of blood clots or strokes\nalternatives to warfarin, the 60yearold mainstay that requires constant monitoring.\nSome data indicate they may lower the risk of stroke more than warfarin. The panel opted to pick Eliquis, which it deemed the best of these new\nblood thinners, over Pradaxa from Boehringer Ingelheim, which was the first to reach the market.\n\n** Xalkori, from Pfizer. This genetargeted cancer drug has dramatic effects in patients who have nonsmall cell lung cancer driven by particular\nsets of genetic mutations. Bach notes that it was really the first cancer drug developed to target a particular cancer driver mutation, and that a\ndiagnostic test to predict which patients would respond was ready when it was approved. It also charted a new path, getting accelerated approval\nwith a companion diagnostic just four years after the driver was identified.\n\n\n** Yervoy, from BristolMyers Squibb. Approved in 2011, Yervoy was the first new treatmet for\nmetastatic melanoma, the deadly skin cancer, in a decade. It is also the opening salvo in a series of new\ncancer medicines that work by encouraging the immune system to attack tumors.\n\n\n* Perjeta, from Roche. This drug is an heir to Herceptin, the incredibly effective breast cancer treatment. Perjeta is even more effective.\n\nOne concern that made all of the judges uneasy was the issue of price. All of these medicines are expensive, and Kalydeco is the priciest, with a list\nprice of $305,000 per patient per year. Several times, we considered making price a factor in the decision, but at the end of the day we did not factor\nit in precisely because so many of the drugs were so expensive. What should we do, pick Yervoy, which, in combination with a newer Bristol drug\ncalled Opdivo, can cost $256,000 to treat one patient for one year? In the end, drug pricing is a systemic problem.\n\nHere’s what swayed us to pick Kalydeco: it’s dramatic effect in a deadly disease that cuts people down early in life. The gene for cystic fibrosis was\ndiscovered in 1989. It took three decades for a treatment to emerge from that work, and even then it only works in a small sliver of patients. (Vertex\nhas a new treatment, Orkambi, that aims to extend this benefit to other types of CF mutations, but the results are less impressive despite a similar\ncost to Kalydeco.) That’s a major breakthrough, and represents the best that the pharmaceutical industry has to offer.\n\n                                                                         Version 2 2/2017\n\f	Policy_Toolkit_V2_Q12017_FINAL_472.pdf	PDF	22	135	f	2017-08-14 05:57:17.858217	2017-08-21 07:03:09.135411	t	278753	1	272 KB

116	Overview	           ENSURING APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO PRESCRIPTION\n                  DRUG COVERAGE ACROSS STATES\n\n Each State’s Medicaid drug review process is well-positioned to either secure or\n   restrict appropriate access to FDA-approved medicines, directly impacting\n                                    patients.\nProcedural best practices that result in appropriate drug coverage\n• Consistent, Advanced Public Notification: States that provide regular, advanced public notice of drugs and\n  associated initial recommendations allow treating physicians, manufacturers, and the patient community to\n  prepare appropriate questions and testimony.\n• Informed Board Members that Seek Expert Input: Often, the states that adopt clinical criteria consistent\n  with the FDA-approved label are those with educated and informed committee members who seek expert\n  input when members do not have sufficient clinical expertise, especially for medicines that treat rare diseases.\n  When experts are consulted, they are able to weigh in on the draft clinical criteria and ensure it is medically\n  appropriate.\n• Transparent Decision Making: The best outcomes occur in states where all voting happens at the public\n  hearing, allowing for experts in the disease state and patients to provide input.\n\n\n\n\nUnpredictable and non-transparent practices impact coverage decisions\n\n• Reliance on Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs): Community standards of care recommended by state-\n  based physicians can be overlooked if drug review process is over-reliant on PBM guidance outside of expert\n  input.\n• Non-Transparent Decision-Making: Clinical criteria recommendations voted on behind closed doors often do\n  not provide sufficient opportunity for input from state-based physician community.\n• Delays in Access to Innovative Medicines: Unpredictable meeting schedules or cancelled meetings can\n  result in delayed coverage determinations, resulting in delayed access to innovative medicines for patients.\n• Cost Considerations: While by statue states are not allowed to consider costs when stipulating prior\n  authorization criteria, this happens regularly in practice. Clinical criteria should be determined by the body of\n  clinical evidence available, not cost.\n• Lack of transparent process for innovator products: Some states lack transparent procedures to deal with\n  products that fall outside an established drug class, often specialty drugs. Without following an established\n  process, non-transparent coverage determinations can be made.\n\n\n\n\n      Version 2 2/2017\n\f	Overview.pdf	PDF	21	138	f	2017-08-14 06:08:00.865581	2017-08-21 07:03:09.463902	t	311565	1	304 KB

If the installer does not launch automatically, open the folder, navigate to the\n       Adobe CS5 folder, double-click Set-up.exe, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n       Mac:\n       Insert the DVD in your drive, navigate to the Adobe Photoshop CS5 folder found at the root\n       level on the DVD, double-click Install.app, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n       If you downloaded the software from the web, open the folder, navigate to the application\n       folder, double-click Install.app, and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n\n   4. If you are installing as an upgrade, the installer will check your system to find a valid\n      upgrade product. If it cannot find one, it will ask you to input the serial number of the\n      product being upgraded. You can also install the software as a trial, then input your new and\n      previous serial numbers in the serialization screen shown during launch.\n   5. For additional CS5 installation help, go to www.adobe.com/go/cs5install/.\n\nAdobe Photoshop CS5 and Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended\n\nBoth Adobe Photoshop CS5 and Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended have the option to run natively in\neither 32-bit or 64-bit editions of Windows® Vista® Home Premium, Business, Ultimate, or\nEnterprise with Service Pack 2, Windows® 7 or Macintosh OSX v10.5.7 - 10.6.2.\n\nMacintosh 64-bit\n\nPhotoshop will automatically detect and run the 64-bit version on 64-bit Macintosh systems. To\nforce Photoshop to launch the 32-bit version, navigate to the application and "Get Info" (Control +\nClick on the application icon), then select the "Open in 32-bit mode" checkbox.\n\nMicrosoft® Vista® or Windows 7\n\nPhotoshop will automatically install the 32-bit version of Photoshop CS5 if you are on a 32-bit\nWindows OS. Photoshop will install both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Photoshop on 64-bit\nsystems. To install only the Photoshop 64-bit version on a 64-bit Windows OS, follow the steps\nbelow:\n\n   1. Run the Photoshop CS5 installer.\n   2. Enter your serial number. Click Accept.\n   3. On the right side of the Options panel under the 64-bit heading, uncheck the box for Adobe\n      Photoshop CS5. Leave the "Adobe Photoshop CS5 (64-bit)" option checked.\n   4. Finish installation.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fKnown issues\n\n   •   On Mac, you cannot install to the root directory of the boot drive.\n   •   When installing on Vista64, an incorrect default installation location appears. The\n       application will be installed in the correct location: C:\\Program Files (x86).\n   •   The "Total Size" displayed in the Installer Options screen includes space required for\n       components required for the installation but NOT shown in the component list; the number\n       may not equal the listed components size.\n   •   For more detailed information about troubleshooting your installation, go\n       to www.adobe.com/go/support_loganalyzer.\n\nNote: In order to install additional components or reinstall your software after your original\ninstallation, you will need access to the original installer (CD, DVD or the download from the\nweb). Repair is not an available option.\n\n   •   If you are running Microsoft® Windows® XP with Service Pack 3, Photoshop will run in\n       both 32-bit and 64-bit editions. However, we do not officially support the 64-bit edition and\n       you may run into problems.\n   •   If you install Photoshop CS5 on your system and then install Photoshop CS4 afterward, you\n       will not in the future be able to use the Photoshop CS4 installer to repair your Photoshop\n       CS4 installation. To do the repair, you must uninstall Photoshop CS4 and then reinstall it.\n\nUninstall your software\nBefore you uninstall, close all applications currently running on your system (including other Adobe\napplications, Microsoft Office applications, and browser windows).\n\nDo one of the following:\n\n   •   In Windows® XP, open the Windows Control Panel and double-click Add or Remove\n       Programs. Select the product that you want to uninstall, click Change/Remove, then follow\n       the on-screen instructions.\n   •   In Windows® Vista® and Windows® 7, open the Windows Control Panel and double-click\n       Programs and Features. Select the product that you want to uninstall, click Uninstall, then\n       follow the on-screen instructions.\n   •   IMPORTANT: Mac OS has new uninstall functionality. DO NOT drag applications to the\n       trash to uninstall them. To safely uninstall on Mac OS X, double-click the product installer\n       in Applications/Utilities/Adobe Installers or double-click on the Uninstall alias located in the\n       Application folder. Select Remove Preferences, then Authenticate as an Administrator and\n       follow the on-screen instructions.\n\nNote: We allow you to install on two computers per serial number. If you have done so, but want to\ninstall the product on a new machine, you must first deactivate the software on one of your\ncomputers. To deactivate, either choose Help > Deactivate or check the Deactivate checkbox during\nthe uninstall process.\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fTrial software\nEntering a serial number\n\nEnter the serial number for the software you purchased in the serialization screen. The serialization\nscreen will load the first time you launch the application. You can enter a serial number for the\napplication itself or a serial number for any Creative Suite that contains the application. If the\nproduct you purchased is one of the Creative Suites, you can enter the serial number in any of the\napplications contained in the Creative Suite. Other applications installed as part of the same Creative\nSuite will recognize the new serial number the next time the applications are launched.\n\nOnly applications running as a trial will recognize the new serial number. If any of the applications\nhave already been serialized with a different serial number, they will continue to use that serial\nnumber until you remove the older serial number using Help > Deactivate > Deactivate\nPermanently. After selecting this option, they will recognize the new serial number on the next\nlaunch of the application.\n\nThe serial number you purchased is for the use of the software in a specific language, and will only\nbe accepted by a product installed in that language.\n\nVolume licensing\n\nVolume licensing customers cannot purchase from a trial directly. However, a volume licensing\nserial number can be used to serialize all Creative Suite applications, except the Acrobat 9 trial or\nretail versions that ship with Creative Suite. Photoshop CS5 volume licensing software must be\npurchased from an authorized Adobe licensing center. Please contact your reseller or authorized\nAdobe licensing center to place an order for a volume license. To find a reseller in your area, go to\nhttp://partners.adobe.com/resellerfinder/na/reseller.jsp.\n\nElectronic licensing\nYou must accept the license agreement and warranty terms to use this product.\nSee www.adobe.com/go/eulas for details. This product may automatically attempt to activate over\nthe Internet. See www.adobe.com/go/activation for details.\n\nRegistration information\nCreating an Adobe ID registers your software and sets up access to Adobe CS Live online services.\nIn order to take advantage of your complimentary subscription of CS Live services, and get up-to-\ndate product information, training, newsletters, and invitations to Adobe events and seminars, you\nmust register your product.\n\nFont installation\nAll font related documentation is online. Visit\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/creativesuite/creativesuite5.html to find our OpenType\n                                                5\n\fUser Guide, OpenType Read Me, links to font-specific Read Me documents, listings of fonts\ninstalled by the different CS5 products, and listings of fonts included on DVD for each of the CS5\nproducts.\n\nThe Creative Suite 5 installer installs fonts into a default system font directory. Many of these fonts\nare newer versions of fonts installed by Creative Suite 4. If the installer finds older versions of these\nfonts in the default system font directory, it will uninstall the older versions, and save them to a new\ndirectory. The default system font directory is:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Fonts\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Windows\\Fonts\n\nThe older fonts will be saved in the new directory:\n\n   •   Mac: <System Disk>/Library/Application Support/Adobe/SavedFonts/current\n   •   Windows: <System Disk>:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\SavedFonts\\current\n\nThis new directory will also contain a file named "Read Me.html" which lists the saved fonts, as\nwell as the version numbers of the new and old font files.\n\nYou can re-install the older fonts by deleting the new font files from the default system font\ndirectory and moving the old files back into that directory.\n\nThere are additional fonts on the installation disc. For information on installing these fonts, see\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/learn_fontinstall_en.\n\nKnown issues\nPlease refer to Adobe Support for late-breaking information and known issues for all Creative Suite\n5 applications.\n\n64-bit issues\n\nOn Macintosh only, several plug-ins are no longer supported for 64-bit systems. These plug-ins will\nonly run in 32-bit mode:\n\n   •   Embed/Read Watermark\n   •   Lighting Effects\n   •   Send Video Preview to Device\n   •   Variations\n   •   Video Preview\n   •   Optional plug-ins (Contact Sheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI, Web Photo Gallery).\n       NOTE: These plug-ins are not included in your Photoshop CS5 install. You can find more\n       info at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain the\n       plug-ins along with the Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fYou may encounter instabilities with some third-party Carbon plug-ins from CS4 or earlier. We\ntherefore recommend that you do not copy third-party plug-ins directly to the Photoshop Plug-ins\nfolder. Third-party plug-ins should be stored in a separate folder and then loaded via Preferences >\nPlug-ins > Additional Plug-ins. If instabilities occur in the app, either through general use or when\nusing a plug-in directly, follow the plug-in troubleshooting guidelines\nat go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb409112_en-us to resolve the issue.\n\nExtract plug-in\n\nThe Extract plug-in is no longer supported in Photoshop CS5. We highly recommend you use\nRefine Edge and the Quick Select Tool for optimal selections.\n\nGB18030 support for Windows XP\n\nIn order to support the display of all characters of the Chinese standard GB18030 on Windows XP\nsystems, Adobe recommends the installation of the Microsoft GB18030 Support Package. This\nsupport package will update an XP system with, among other things, fonts and input-method-editors\n(IMEs) to correctly support GB18030. The support package is available as a download from the\nMicrosoft website.\n\nGPU and video card support\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 includes support for graphics card acceleration by using the graphics card's\n       Graphics Processing Unit. On Windows XP, or if you are using an unsupported card,\n       OpenGL is turned off by default. This means that features that rely on GPU support will not\n       be available. For a list of features relying on this support, refer to the GPU guidance\n       at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n   •   The Nvidia 7300GT will not work properly with OpenGL on Macintosh systems prior to\n       10.6. We advise you to upgrade to 10.6 if you would like to enable OpenGL functionality.\n\nHow-To links (Help > How To...)\n\nAll How-To links have been removed from Photoshop CS5.\n\nJPEG 2000\n\nThis plug-in is now included in the Photoshop CS5 default install. You no longer need to install it\n(from Photoshop CS4) as an optional plug-in.\n\nOptional plug-ins not installed in Photoshop CS5 and downloadable online\n\n   •   PDF Presentation and Web Photo Gallery can be found in Bridge CS5 in the Adobe Output\n       Model (AOM). If you want to download the Photoshop CS5 versions of PDF Presentation\n       and Web Photo Gallery, please see the following document for\n       information: go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download package will contain\n       the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fNOTE: The Web Photo Gallery plug-in does not work in Photoshop Mac 64-bit; you must launch\nPhotoshop in 32-bit mode to use this legacy plug-in on the Mac.\n\n   •   ContactSheet, Pattern Maker, PhotomergeUI and Picture Package are also not installed in\n       Photoshop CS5 along with the Textures and Layouts presets. If you want to download these\n       plug-ins, you can find them at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us. This download\n       package will contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me.\n\nNOTE: ContactSheet, PatternMaker and Photomerge plug-ins do not work on Photoshop Mac 64-\nbit; you must launch Photoshop in 32-bit mode to use these legacy plug-ins on the Mac.\n\nFor more information on support and download locations, go to\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_mac_en or\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/ps_cs5_plugins_win_en.\n\nOther Optional plug-ins:\n\n   •   Firewire and FirewireDLL are supported only on 32-bit systems for Mac & Win.\n   •   TWAIN for 32-bit Macintosh and Windows systems (see below for more information)\n\nPlug-ins, extensions and filters not installed in Photoshop CS5 (normally found in\nGoodies folder in versions prior to Photoshop CS4)\n\n   •   Bigger Tiles has been removed from Photoshop CS5 as the functionality has now been built\n       into the performance preferences. This can now be set in the UI by setting "Cache Tile Size"\n       to 1024K or 1028K in the performance section of Photoshop preferences.\n   •   Filmstrip format (plug-in) for 32-bit/64-bit Macintosh and Windows systems has been\n       removed from the install. In addition, it is no longer available to download.\n\nSave for Web\n\n   •   If you try to save named slices to a directory where that filename already exists, Photoshop\n       will fail to prompt you with an overwrite warning. You will silently overwrite the existing\n       file.\n   •   We have removed the shortcut used to delete the preference file for Save for Web in\n       Photoshop CS5. To manually delete this preference file, navigate to the following locations\n       and delete the Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Preferences file:\n       Windows XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\Application Data\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Windows Vista or Windows 7: C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Save for\n       Web\\12.0\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n       Macintosh: Volume\\username\\Library\\Preferences\\Adobe Save for Web 12.0 Prefs\n\nTool Presets\n\n   •   Photoshop CS5 can read tool presets created by earlier versions of Photoshop, but earlier\n       versions of Photoshop cannot read tool presets created by Photoshop CS5.\n\n                                                 8\n\fType\n\n  •    If you are using the NVIDIA GeForce 7300GT, you may experience performance issues\n       when editing text, especially on large documents. We recommend that you upgrade your\n       video card for a better experience. For more information on this card and support options,\n       please refer to the GPU guidance document located at go.adobe.com/kb/ts_kb404898_en-us.\n       This card is extremely problematic for many areas in Photoshop and we suggest you contact\n       the manufacturer for more information if needed.\n  •    The Japanese text input mode Koteoeri/ATOK is not supported on Mac OS 10.5.x and\n       earlier. You may experience slowdowns and lack of response when attempting to use this\n       input method. Please contact Apple support if you would like more information on this. We\n       recommend that you upgrade to Mac OS 10.6 to resolve this issue.\n  •    The legacy shortcut to duplicate and transform (Cmd + Opt + T) on Mac 10.5 now opens the\n       Character panel.\n\nTWAIN support\n\n  •    Photoshop does not install the TWAIN plug-in for Photoshop CS5. For information on\n       TWAIN support and download, refer to go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_82824_en-us or contact\n       the manufacturer of your device for further TWAIN support. The download package will\n       contain the plug-in along with Optional Plug-ins Read Me for Photoshop CS5. Do not use\n       the TWAIN plug-in from Photoshop CS4 downloads.\n  •    64-bit Support: 64-bit TWAIN scanners are not officially supported in either 64-bit or 32-bit\n       Photoshop. Use at your own risk. However we have found that the Canon PIXMA MP990\n       (64-bit) works well on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Mac OS 10.6. If you need to use a\n       TWAIN scanner, we recommend that you use this scanner and upgrade to Mac OS 10.6.\n\nPHOTOSHOP CS5 EXTENDED KNOWN ISSUES\n\n3D General\n\n  •    The Nvidia GeForce 7300GT is a problematic card, especially for 3D in Photoshop on\n       Macintosh OS < 10.6. You may experience frequent crashes as well as limited functionality.\n       We recommend that you upgrade your Macintosh systems to 10.6 for a better experience.\n  •    Adobe Repoussé is dependant on OpenGL; you must have a OpenGL supported card. See\n       go.adobe.com/kb/ts_cpsid_83117_en-us for a list of supported cards and troubleshooting\n       tips.\n  •    3D objects imported (OBJ and KMZ) with missing textures may need to have their Opacity\n       manually changed to 100%. Many applications will export objects with Opacity set to 0%\n       and therefore Photoshop reads this material as fully transparent.\n  •    When creating holes using Adobe Repoussé from type layers, you may experience missing\n       geometry on the front face of the mesh if the font size is too small relative to the hole.\n  •    Image Based Lights do not have a specular component; gloss and shine maps will not have\n       any effect.\n\nCollada DAE/KMZ file format\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fDAE/KMZ mesh/model pieces may show up in the wrong place. This is because we do not create\nmeshes for polygon types like Lines and Points. In addition, because the mesh hierarchy is not\naccurate, transformations may not be in the right place. Unfortunately, as we do not support lines\nand points in our renderer, we currently have no way to resolve this issue.\n\nGoogle Warehouse 3D files (Collada) from Sketch-up 7.1\n\nGoogle Sketchup 7.1 changed the way they export their Collada format. If you have a Google 3D\nCollada file (DAE/KMZ) where it opens with missing meshes or textures, the file needs to be re-\nexported from Sketchup 7.1 or later with the Export parameter "Preserve Component hierarchies"\nunchecked.\n\nPoser 3D Collada files\n\nModels exported from Poser will often come into Photoshop with Opacity of textures set to 0%. To\nview these textures, simply change Opacity to 100% for all textures.\n\nCustomer care\nCustomer Service\n\nAdobe Customer Service provides assistance with product information, sales, registration, and other\nnon-technical issues.

15	Pennsylvania 2nd Annual Rare Disease Day	       PENNSLYVANNIA 2ND\n              ANNUAL\n       R A R E D I S E A S E D AY\n\n\n\n\n                   Pennsylvania Bio joined a robust coalition of patient advocate groups in Harrisburg for a very\n                   successful recognition of Rare Disease Day on March 16. The event occurred in the Main Capitol\n                   Rotunda which featured a press conference where the new Rare Disease Caucus was announced.\n                   Pennsylvania Bio is pleased to report that the number of caucus members grew from 18 to 25 by the\n                   end of the press conference.\n\n                   In the weeks and months ahead, this bi-partisan and bi-cameral caucus will work to educate other\n                   legislators on the needs and challenges of the 1.2 million Pennsylvanians who have a rare disease.\n                   They will also introduce legislation that will support rare disease patients and their caregivers in\n                   the state.\n\n                   This event was the work of a planning committee that Pennsylvania Bio joined after last year’s Rare\n                   Disease Day and is led by Kyle Bryant of the Friedreichs Ataxia Foundation.

66	Talking Points: Government Price Negotiation	TPs in response to Gov’t Price Negotiation\n• It’s wrong to look at pharmaceutical pricing in isolation. Policymakers have to look at\n  broader health ecosystem. Solutions should be aimed at “bending the broader curve” and\n  not on Rx alone.\n         o     Spending on prescription medicines is only a fraction of overall healthcare spending in the US and has\n               remained steady over the last 50 years\n         o     Consumers see their out-of-pocket costs rising and are told that the pharmaceutical industry is to\n               blame\n         o     However, hospital and physician costs will make up more than 60% of the projected $13.7 trillion\n               spent on healthcare over the next decade; prescription drug costs make up 10 percent.\n         o     Removing ALL pharmaceutical profits from the system would not provide significant cost savings. It\n               would simply delay U.S. healthcare inflation by one year or less. But it would eliminate the discovery\n               of any new medicines in the future.\n•      The current system is working. PBMs/plans have been successful in securing discounts in\n       Part D; many non-partisan analyses show that the government would not be more\n       successful at negotiating drug prices.\n         o     The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the federal government "would be\n               unable to negotiate prices…that are more favorable than those obtained" by private insurers.\n         o     “estimated to reduce federal Medicare spending by approximately $870 million in 2014,” and in the\n               next decade “estimated to reduce federal Medicare spending by $7.9 to $9.3 billion.”\n•      This policy harms patients. In addition to government price negotiation, this proposed\n       policy (MAY) allow regulators to deny certain drugs to patients, which could cause\n       significant patient harm.\n         o     Patients MAY have to try cheaper, less effective drugs first, before gaining access to needed\n               therapies.\n         o     This type of policy would disproportionately harm CF patients because there are no other\n               medications available that treat the underlying cause of CF.\n•      This policy will hamper innovation.\n         o     $2.6 billion per drug, according to a Tufts study.\n         o     Biotech cos are willing to spend such vast sums because they know that if a drug pans out, they'll\n               have a chance to sell it and recoup the cost of their investment.\n         o     If federal regulators have the power to exclude medicines from coverage, drug makers won't have\n               that chance - they'll be less willing to invest in risky -- but potentially groundbreaking -- new\n               treatment.\n•      Vertex supports policies that focus on market-based solutions.\n         o     Encourage more generic approvals (increased competition) by FDA.\n         o     Accelerate FDA approvals of biosimilars (generic biologics).\n         o     Eliminate large price increases on old generic drugs (Turing)\n         o     Voluntary limits on annual price increases (THIS IS FROM BOARD DECK – DO WE WANT TO SAY THIS?)\n•      Vertex is a true innovator.\n         •      Exclusive focus on high value, transformative medicines\n         o      Vast majority of OpEx spent on RD\n         o      Focus on orphan – high value and high per patient cost with comparatively low impact on the\n                broader system\n         o      Per patient cost decreasing as total patients treated increases.\n         o      No large annual price increases\n\n\n    Version 2 2/2017\n\f	Policy_Toolkit_V2_Q12017_FINAL_416.pdf	PDF	20	88	f	2017-08-14 05:29:14.761251	2017-08-21 07:03:11.219726	t	317406	1	310 KB

Health care: prescription drug costs.\n        Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Knox-Keene Act), provides for the\n     licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) and\n     makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers by\n     the Department of Insurance (DOI). Existing law requires health care service plans and health insurers to file\n     specified rate information with DMHC or DOI, as applicable, for health care service plan contracts or health\n     insurance policies in the individual or small group markets and for health care service plan contracts and\n     health insurance policies in the large group market.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f  SB 1010                         — 2—\n\n\n\n    This bill would require health care service plans or health insurers that file the\n  above-described rate information to report to DMHC or DOI, on a date no later\n  than the reporting of the rate information, specified cost information regarding\n  covered prescription drugs, including generic drugs, brand name drugs, and specialty\n  drugs provided in an outpatient setting. The information reported would include,\n  but not be limited to, the 25 most frequently prescribed drugs and the 25 most\n  costly drugs by total plan or insurer spending. DMHC and DOI would be required\n  to compile the reported information into a report for the public and legislators that\n  demonstrates the overall impact of drug costs on health care premiums and publish\n  the reports on their Internet Web sites by October 1 of each year. Except for the\n  report, DMHC and DOI would be required to keep confidential all information\n  provided pursuant to these provisions.\n    Because a willful violation of the Knox-Keene Act is a crime, this bill would\n  impose a state-mandated local program.\n    This bill bill, except as provided, would require a manufacturer of a branded\n  prescription drug to notify in writing state purchasers, health care service plans,\n  health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, and the chairs of specified Senate and\n  Assembly committees if it is increasing the wholesale acquisition cost of the drug\n  by more than 10% or by more than $10,000 during any 12-month period.

The bill would require a manufacturer of a prescription drug to notify in\n  writing, within 3 days of approval by the federal Food and Drug Administration,\n  state purchasers, health care service plans, health insurers, pharmacy benefit\n  managers, and the chairs of specified Senate and Assembly committees if it is\n  introducing a new prescription drug to market at a wholesale acquisition cost of\n  $10,000 or more annually or per course of treatment.

The bill would also\n  require the Legislature to conduct an annual public hearing regarding the\n  aggregate trends in prescription drug pricing, as prescribed. Except for the\n  hearing, the The bill would also require a pharmacy benefit manager that\n  receives notice of a price increase consistent with these provisions to provide\n  notice of the price increase to its contracting public and private purchasers,\n  as provided.

Health care coverage: outpatient prescription drugs.\n      (1)Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975,\n      provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the\n      Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the\n      act a crime. Existing law also provides for the regulation of health insurers\n      by the Department of Insurance. Existing law requires a health care service\n      plan or insurer that provides prescription drug benefits and maintains one\n      or more drug formularies to make specified information regarding the\n      formularies available to the public and other specified entities. Existing law\n      also specifies requirements for those plans and insurers regarding coverage\n      and cost sharing of specified prescription drugs.\n         This bill would prohibit the formulary or formularies for outpatient\n      prescription drugs maintained by a health care service plan or health insurer\n      from discouraging the enrollment of individuals with health conditions and\n      from reducing the generosity of the benefit for enrollees or insureds with a\n      particular condition. The bill, until January 1, 2020, would provide that the\n      copayment, coinsurance, or any other form of cost sharing for a covered\n      outpatient prescription drug for an individual prescription shall not exceed\n      $250 for a supply of up to 30 days, except as specified, and would prohibit,\n      for a nongrandfathered individual or small group plan contract or policy,\n      the annual deductible for outpatient drugs from exceeding a specified\n      amount. The bill would make these cost-sharing limits applicable only to\n      covered outpatient prescription drugs that constitute essential health benefits,\n      as defined. The bill would require a plan contract or policy to cover a\n      single-tablet prescription drug regimen for combination antiretroviral drug\n      treatments that are medically necessary for the treatment of AIDS/HIV, as\n      specified. The bill, until January 1, 2020, would require a nongrandfathered\n      individual or small group plan contract or policy to use specified definitions\n      for each tier of a drug formulary. The bill would make related findings and\n      declarations.\n\n\n\n                                                                                   88\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f     Ch. 619                             — 2—\n\n        This bill would require a health care service plan contract or health\n     insurance policy that provides coverage for outpatient prescription drugs to\n     provide coverage for medically necessary prescription drugs, including\n     nonformulary drugs determined to be medically necessary, and, for an\n     insurer, would require copayments, coinsurance, and other cost sharing for\n     outpatient prescription drugs to be reasonable.\n        This bill would make these provisions applicable to nongrandfathered\n     health care service plan contracts or health insurance policies that are offered,\n     renewed, or amended on or after January 1, 2017.\n     (2)Existing law requires every health care service plan that provides\n     prescription drug benefits to maintain specified information that is required\n     to be made available to the Director of the Department of Managed Health\n     Care upon request.\n        This bill would also impose these requirements on a health insurer that\n     provides prescription drug benefits, as provided. The bill would authorize\n     an insurer to require step therapy, as defined, when more than one drug is\n     appropriate for the treatment of a medical condition, subject to specified\n     requirements. The bill, with regard to an insured changing policies, would\n     prohibit a new insurer from requiring the insured to repeat step therapy\n     when that person is already being treated for a medical condition by a\n     prescription drug, as specified. For plan years commencing on or after\n     January 1, 2017, the bill, except as specified, would require a plan or insurer\n     that provides essential health benefits to allow an enrollee or insured to\n     access his or her prescription drug benefits at an in-network retail pharmacy,\n     and would authorize a nongrandfathered individual or small group plan or\n     insurer to charge an enrollee or insured a different cost sharing for obtaining\n     a covered drug at a retail pharmacy, and would require that cost-sharing\n     amount to count towards the plan’s or insurer’s annual out-of-pocket\n     limitation, as specified.\n        This bill, commencing January 1, 2017, would require a plan or insurer\n     to maintain a pharmacy and therapeutics committee that is responsible for\n     developing, maintaining, and overseeing any drug formulary list, as provided.\n     The bill would require the committee to, among other things, evaluate and\n     analyze treatment protocols and procedures related to the plan’s or insurer’s\n     drug formulary at least annually.\n     (3)Existing law requires the Department of Managed Health Care and the\n     Department of Insurance to jointly develop a standard formulary template by\n     January 1, 2017, and requires plans and insurers to use that template to\n     display formularies, as specified. Existing law requires the standard\n     formulary template to include specified information.\n        This bill would require the standard formulary template to include\n     additional specified information, including which medications are covered,\n     including both generic and brand name.\n     (4)Because a willful violation of the bill’s requirements relative to health\n     care service plans would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated\n     local program.\n\n\n\n                                                                                   88\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                                        —3—                                Ch. 619\n\n        The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies\n     and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory\n     provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n        This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for\n     a specified reason.\n\n       The people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n        SECTION 1.

Sections of the Bill that have no relevance to Vertex or its products are omitted. The Bill,\n      which was passed by the legislature, has not yet been signed by the governor.\n\n      I.           Executive Summary\n\n      First, starting in 2017, plans must cover all medically necessary drugs—including those not on formulary—\n      and limit cost sharing for prescription drugs to $250 for a 30-day supply (or $500 for bronze level plans).\n      Similarly, the annual deductible for drugs would be limited to $500 (or $1,000 for bronze-level plans).\n      Additionally, if a plan has four tiers in their formulary, the law specifies which drugs must be placed on\n      which tiers, and requires that placement of drugs on a tier be based on clinically indicated medical\n      management practices. These requirements would expire at the beginning of 2020, with Medi-Cal plans\n      exempt.\n\n      However, while the above-mentioned requirements do expire at the beginning of 2020, another section of\n      the law—with some similar protections—becomes operative on January 1, 2020. This section, which does\n      not exempt Medi-Cal plans, also requires that all “medically necessary” drugs be covered and that cost\n      sharing schemes be “reasonable” to ensure access to medically necessary drugs. While plans may still use\n      formularies, step therapy and prior authorization (PA), tiering must be based on “clinically indicated,\n      reasonable medical management practices” and utilization management (UM) must be “consistent with\n      and based on clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed scientific and medical literature.”\n\n      Second, all plans would be required to establish a pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) committee as of\n      January 1, 2017. The law specifies the composition of the committee and its duties. There is no expiration\n      date for this provision and Medi-Cal plans are not exempt.\n\n      Third, the law increases health insurer disclosure requirements. Plans would be required to make\n      formularies available not only to insureds, but also to providers, the general public, and government\n      agencies. The formularies must be updated monthly and must include information on the medications\n      covered and the tier on which each medication is placed. There is no expiration date for this provision and\n      Medi-Cal plans are not exempt.\n\n      Overall, the Bill appears to be generally favorable to Vertex. Banning discrimination via specialty tiering,\n      ensuring that decisions must be made based on clinical guidelines, and establishing a P&T committee are\n      all likely to decrease barriers put up by insurance companies to prevent access to expensive drugs. The\n      copay caps will be of limited impact given Vertex’s patient population and the Patient Assistance Program;\n      however, patients with high annual deductibles will benefit from the new limits.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f      II.          Major Provisions\n\n                   A. Sections 1 & 2\n\n      Section 1 aims to prohibit the placement of medications that treat a specific—and often expensive—\n      medical condition to the highest tier of a formulary. Plans that offer drug plans must cover all “medically\n      necessary” drugs, including those not on a formulary. Additionally, plans must not reduce benefits for\n      those with a particular condition, unless based on “reasonable medical management” practices.\n\n      Section 1 also places limits on cost sharing for covered outpatient prescription drugs that are considered\n      part of essential health benefits (EHB). Plans may not charge more than $250 for a 30-day supply (if the\n      individual is enrolled in a bronze-level plan, the limit is $500). Similarly, the annual deductible for drugs is\n      limited to $500 (for bronze-level plans, the limit is $1,000). Patients must still pay the annual deductible\n      before the 30-day supply limits apply.\n\n      Finally, Section 1 provides parameters on how drug plans may structure formularies, provided the plan has\n      a fourth tier. Tier 1 must include most generic and low-cost preferred brand name drugs; tier 2 must\n      include nonpreferred generic drugs, preferred brand name drugs, and other drugs recommended by the\n      P&T committee; tier 3 must include nonpreferred brand name drugs, drugs recommended by the P&T or\n      drugs that have a less costly alternative at a lower tier; and tier 4 drugs must include biologics, specialty\n      pharmacy drugs, drugs that require training for self-administration, or drugs that cost more than\n      $600/month (net of rebates). Nothing prohibits a plan from placing a drug on a lower tier, and the\n      placement of a drug on a tier must be based on “clinically indicated, reasonable medical management\n      practices.” This section also specifically allows plans to use formularies, PA, step therapy or other\n      “reasonable medical management practices” for drugs.\n\n      Section 1 applies to all nongrandfathered plans that are offered, amended, or renewed on or after January\n      1, 2017. Medi-Cal plans are exempt from these requirements. The section would expire on January 1, 2020\n      absent additional legislation.\n\n      Section 2 imposes no additional requirements beyond those in Section 1.\n\n                   B. Section 3\n\n      Section 3 requires plans to establish a P&T committee and specifies the duties and composition of the\n      membership of the committee. Specifically, (1) committee members must represent a “sufficient number\n      of clinical specialties to adequately meet the needs of enrollees;” (2) a majority of members must be\n      practicing physicians, practicing pharmacists, and other practicing health professionals who are licensed to\n      prescribe drugs; (3) members must abstain from voting if there is a conflict of interest with a\n      manufacturer; and (4) at least 20 percent of members must not have a conflict of interest.\n\n      The P&T committee is responsible for (1) meeting at least quarterly and maintaining documentation on\n      the rationale for decisions; (2) developing procedures to ensure appropriate review; (3) basing decisions\n      on “strength of scientific evidence and standards of practice,” including peer-reviewed literature,\n      outcomes research data, etc.; (4) considering therapeutic advantages of drugs in terms of safety and\n      efficacy; (5) reviewing drug utilization mechanisms; (6) evaluating treatment protocols for a plan’s\n      formulary at least annually; (7) reviewing and approving all clinical PA criteria, step therapy protocols, and\n      quantity limit restrictions; (8) reviewing new FDA-approved drugs and new uses for existing drugs; and (9)\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f      ensuring formularies have appropriate access to drugs that are “included in broadly accepted treatment\n      guidelines and that are indicative of general best practices at the time.”\n\n      Section 3 applies to individual, small group, and large group markets starting on January 1, 2017. There is\n      no sunset provision in this section.\n\n                   C. Section 4\n\n      Section 4 requires that plans that provide EHB allow enrollees to access prescription drugs at an in-\n      network retail pharmacy, unless the drug is subject to restricted distribution or requires special\n      handling/patient education that can’t be provided by a retail pharmacy. The section also notes that\n      nongrandfathered individual or small group plans may charge an enrollee different cost sharing for\n      obtaining a covered drug at a retail pharmacy, but all cost sharing must count toward the plan’s annual\n      limitation.\n\n      Section 4 applies to all plans that provide EHB, starting on January 1, 2017.\n\n                   D. Sections 5 & 6\n\n      Sections 5 and 6 modify health care service plan and insurer disclosure requirements, respectively, such\n      that formularies must be made available not only to insureds, but also to providers, the general public,\n      and other government agencies, and must be updated monthly. The section also modifies the standard\n      formulary template to include information on medications covered and the tier on which each medication\n      is placed (must be done by January 1, 2017).\n\n      Section 5 applies to all health care service plans that provide prescription drug benefits and maintain a\n      formulary.\n\n                   E. Section 7\n\n      Section 7 is largely identical to Section 1. There are only two differences—this section requires that (1)\n      cost sharing for outpatient prescription drugs be “reasonable so as to allow access to medically necessary\n      outpatient prescription drugs;” and (2) utilization management be consistent with clinical guidelines and\n      peer-reviewed medical literature.\n\n      As with Section 1, Section 7 applies to all nongrandfathered plans that are offered, amended, or renewed\n      on or after January 1, 2017. Medi-Cal plans are exempt, and the section would expire on January 1, 2020\n      absent additional legislation.\n\n                   F. Section 8\n\n      Section 8 requires that plans that offer prescription drug plans cover “medically necessary” drugs,\n      including nonformulary drugs. It also mandates that copays/coinsurance for drugs be “reasonable” so as\n      to allow access to medically necessary drugs. It prohibits discriminatory formulary practices and requires\n      that placement of drugs on tiers be based on “clinically indicated, reasonable medical management\n      practices.” It prohibits plans from reducing benefits due to a particular medication condition unless based\n      on reasonable medical management practices. Finally, Section 8 specifically allows plans to use\n      formularies, PA, step therapy, or other medical management practices, but also requires that such\n      practices be based on “clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed scientific and medical literature.”\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f      Section 8 applies to all nongrandfathered plans that are offered, amended, or renewed on or after January\n      1, 2017. The section would become operative on January 1, 2020.\n\n                   G. Section 9\n\n      Section 9 requires that plans that provide outpatient prescription drug coverage cover all “medically\n      necessary” drugs and specifies that plans may use step therapy (when there is more than one drug\n      appropriate for the treatment of a medical condition) and PA. This section clarifies, however, that when\n      an insured changes policies, the new policy must not require an insured to repeat step therapy when the\n      insured is already being treated with a prescription drug (provided the drug was appropriately prescribed\n      in the first place). Section 9 also states that insurers must cover “the medically necessary dosage and\n      quantity of the drug prescribed for the treatment of a medical condition consistent with professionally\n      recognized standards of practice.”\n\n      Section 9 also mandates that insurers that provide EHB allow an insured to access prescription drugs at an\n      in-network retail pharmacy unless the drug is subject to restricted distribution by the FDA or requires\n      special handling/patient education that cannot be provided by a retail pharmacy. A nongrandfathered\n      individual or small group health insurer may charge an insured a different cost sharing for obtaining a\n      covered drug at a retail pharmacy, but all cost sharing must count toward the policy’s annual limitation on\n      cost sharing.\n\n      This section also requires that insurers that provide prescription drug benefits maintain information on\n      their formularies, including drugs by major therapeutic category with an indication of whether any drugs\n      are preferred over other drugs. The insurer must also disclose information on arrangements with\n      prescribing providers, medical groups, individual practice associations, pharmacists, contracting\n      pharmaceutical benefit management companies, or other entities that are associated with activities of the\n      insurer to encourage formulary compliance or otherwise manage prescription drug benefits. These\n      activities will be monitored by the commissioner for compliance.\n\n      Finally, this section also mandates that insurers maintain a P&T committee, with membership and duty\n      requirements identical to those in Section 3.\n\n      Section 9 applies to individual, small group, and large group markets starting on January 1, 2017.\n\n                   F. Section 10\n\n      Section 10 is not relevant to Vertex.\n\n      III.         Vertex Impact\n\n      Broadly speaking, the purpose of the Bill is to prohibit discrimination based on medical condition and to\n      ensure access to and affordability of medically necessary drugs. Medical necessity is determined by the\n      clinician, although specific criteria are not provided. These goals are accomplished by ensuring that cost\n      sharing is “reasonable,” UM is consistent with clinical guidelines, and tiering is based on clinically\n      indicated medical management practices. While what exactly constitutes “reasonable” cost sharing is\n      unclear, the UM and tiering provisions—which do not expire in 2020—would indicate that insurers must\n      make the availability of Kalydeco and Orkambi consistent with CF care guidelines.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f      Certain portions of the rules regarding P&T committees will also likely be favorable to Vertex. Board\n      membership must be composed of a “sufficient number of clinical specialties to adequately meet the\n      needs of enrollees.” While this is vague, it may be construed to require that a member have sufficient\n      knowledge in the area of rare diseases. Decisions by the P&T committee must also be based on “standards\n      of practice” and formularies must include drugs that are “included in broadly accepted treatment\n      guidelines and that are indicative of general best practices at the time.” This language strongly suggests\n      that Kalydeco and Orkambi would be required to be on any formulary, regardless of whether a clinician\n      deems them “medically necessary.” Similarly, while the law explicitly allows for plans to continue to\n      employ UM techniques, adherence to CF care guidelines would seem to preclude this for CF patients on\n      Kalydeco or Orkambi. A potential negative is that there is little language surrounding transparency and\n      public access to P&T committee records/decisions, although it is possible that this issue could be addressed\n      in agency rules.\n\n      The copay limits in the Bill, which have received the most attention, may actually have little effect on\n      Vertex. First, this portion of the Bill exempts Medi-Cal plans, thereby eliminating its applicability to Vertex\n      patients by between 25 (Kalydeco) and 35 (Orkambi) percent. Second, patients enrolled in Vertex’s Patient\n      Assistance Program generally pay no more than $50/month, thus making the monthly caps in the Bill\n      superfluous. Finally, the copay caps come into force in 2017 and expire in 2020, thus further limiting their\n      impact. The cap on annual deductibles, however, will be beneficial to those patients that have deductibles\n      above $500 ($1,000 for bronze).\n\n      Overall, the Bill appears to be favorable to Vertex, as it limits UM techniques, mandates P&T committees,\n      and in general requires that plans make decisions based on clinical guidelines. The cap on annual\n      deductibles may also prove to be beneficial to Vertex in the short-run.\n\n      IV.          Appendix/Additional Detail on California AB339\n\n                   A.

In 2014 alone, total spending on\n            specialty medications increased by more than 23 percent.\n        (4) The pharmaceutical industry's practice of charging inflated drug prices has resulted in\n            pharmaceutical company profits exceeding those of even the oil and investment banking\n            industries.\n        (5) Inflated drug pricing has led to drug companies lavishing excessive pay on their executives.\n        (6) Excessively priced drugs continue to be an unnecessary burden on Ohio taxpayers that\n            ultimately results in cuts to health care services and providers for people in need.\n        (7) Although Ohio has engaged in efforts to reduce prescription drug costs through rebates,\n             drug manufacturers are still able to charge the State more than other government payers\n             for the same medications, resulting in a dramatic imbalance that must be rectified.\n        (8) If Ohio is able to pay the same prices for prescription drugs as the amounts paid by the\n            United States Department of Veterans Affairs, it would result in significant savings to Ohio\n             and its taxpayers. This Act is necessary and appropriate to address these public concerns.\n        (C) Purposes and Intent.\n        The People of the State of Ohio hereby declare the following purposes and intent in enacting\n        this Act:\n\n        (1) To enable the State of Ohio to pay the same prices for prescription drugs as the prices paid\n            by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, thus rectifying the imbalance among\n            government payers.\n        (2) To enable significant cost savings to Ohio and its taxpayers for prescription drugs, thus\n            helping to stem the tide of rising health care costs in Ohio.\n        (3) To provide for the Act's proper legal defense should it be adopted and thereafter\n            challenged in court.\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f         (D) Drug Pricing.\n\n         (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and insofar as may be permissible under federal\n             law, neither the State of Ohio, nor any state department, agency or other state entity,\n             including, but not limited to, the Ohio Department of Aging, the Ohio Department of Health,\n             the Ohio Department of Insurance, the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services, and\n             the Ohio Department of Medicaid, shall enter into any agreement with the manufacturer of\n             any drug for the purchase of a prescribed drug or agree to pay, directly or indirectly, for a\n             prescribed drug, unless the net cost of the drug, inclusive of cash discounts, free goods,\n             volume discounts, rebates, or any other discounts or credits, as determined by the\n             purchasing department, agency or entity, is the same as or less than the lowest price paid for\n             the same drug by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.\n         (2) The price ceiling described in subsection (1) above also shall apply to all programs where the\n             State of Ohio or any state department, agency or other state entity is the ultimate payer\n             for the drug, even if it did not purchase the drug directly. This includes, but is not limited to,\n             the Ohio Best RxProgram and the Ohio HIV Drug Assistance Program. In addition to\n             agreements for any cash discounts, free goods, volume discounts, rebates, or any other\n             discounts or credits already in place for these programs, the responsible department,\n             agency or entity shall enter into additional agreements with drug manufacturers for further\n             price reductions so that the net cost of the drug, as determined by the purchasing\n             department, agency or entity, is the same as or less than the lowest price paid for the same\n             drug by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.\n         (3) All state departments, agencies and other state entities that enter into one or more\n             agreements with the manufacturer of any drug for the purchase of prescribed drugs or\n             agreement to pay directly or indirectly for prescribed drugs shall implement this section no\n             later than July 1, 2017.\n         (4) Each such department, agency or other state entity, may adopt administrative rules to\n             implement the provisions of this section and may seek any waivers of federal law, rule, or\n             regulation necessary to implement the provisions of this section.\n         (5) The General Assembly shall enact any additional laws and the Governor shall take any\n             additional actions required to promptly carry out the provisions of this section.\n\n\n        (E) Liberal Construction.\n\n        This Act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose.\n\n        (F) Severability.\n\n        If any provision of this Act, or part thereof, or the applicability of any provision or part to any\n        person or circumstances, is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining\n        provisions and parts shall not be affected, but shall remain in full force and effect, and to this\n        end the provisions and parts of this Act are severable. If this Act and another law are approved\n        by the voters at the same election with one or more conflicting provisions and this Act receives\n        fewer votes, the non-conflicting provisions of this Act shall go into effect.\n\n        (G) Legal Defense.\n\n        If any provision of this Act is challenged in court, it shall be defended by the Attorney General of\n        Ohio. The People of Ohio, by enacting this Act, hereby declare that the committee of individuals\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f         responsible for the circulation of the petition proposing this Act ("the Proponents") have a direct\n        and personal stake in defending this Act from constitutional or other challenges. In the event of\n        a challenge, any one or more of the Act's Proponents shall be entitled to assert their direct and\n        personal stake by defending the Act's validity in any court of law, including on appeal. The\n        Proponents shall be indemnified by the State of Ohio for their reasonable attorney's fees and\n        expenses incurred in defending the validity of the challenged Act. In the event that the Act or\n        any of its provisions or parts are held by a court of law, after exhaustion of any appeals, to be\n        unenforceable as being in conflict with other statutory or constitutional provisions, the\n        Proponents shall be jointly and severally liable to pay a civil fine of $10,000 to the State of Ohio,\n        but shall have no other personal liability to any person or entity.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                                           STATEMENT OF CIRCU LATOR\n\n         I,   C:5-f-e//.e.,     - o1J\n                                  D            ,  declare under penalty of election falsification that I am the\n         circulator of the foregoing petition paper containing the signatures of _d                          _\n         electors, that the signatures appended hereto were made and appended in my presence on the date\n         set opposite each respective name, and are the signatures of the persons whose names they purport\n         to be or of attorneys in fact acting pursuant to section 3501.382 of the Revised Code, and that the\n         electors signing this petition did so with knowledge of the contents of same.

The requirement to provide a 60-day notice of a price increase on an\nexisting drug will lead to stockpiling. A purchaser could buy an increased quantity of the medicine all at once, knowing\nthey are guaranteed a ten percent return on this investment. Patients would lose access to the medicine when the\nsupply has been hoarded by others in the supply chain.\n\nSB1010 would not provide a complete picture of drug costs. Spending on medicine has averaged approximately ten\npercent of health care costs because it is the only segment of healthcare where costs go d o w n . Thereis no provision to\ndisclose - e v e n in the aggregate - t h e significant discounts and rebates pharmaceutical manufacturers agree to for both\npublic and private purchasers nor is there any reporting attributable to the "downstream" savings from health care cost\navoidance (e.g.,hospitalizations).\n\nBranded drug manufacturers and generic manufacturers are not treated equally under the bill: an innovator company\nmust report a price increase when the increase is ten percent or greater; a generic manufacturer will now report only\nwhen the price increase is 25 percent or greater. Nearly ninety percent of all drugs dispensed are generic. What is the\nrationale for the significantly higher reporting threshold?\n\nHealth insurance plans and drug companies are not treated equally under the bill: health plans report their data in the\naggregate; drug companies must report on a drug-by-drug basis.\n\nPharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs} have been added to the bill as recipients of manufacturers' information and are\nmiddlemen who negotiate drugs for health plans, and collect huge discounts from drug companies. The bill doesn't\nrequire PBMs to disclose these discounts and whether they are passing them along to patients and payers.\n\nSB 1010 creates a significant new set of reporting requirements o n drug companies. One must ask, whatis the end\ngame ... the purpose of all this data reporting?\n\n\nThank you for your attention to our concerns, and we would be happy to meet and discuss the bill further.\n\n\ncc.

Despite amendments to the bill\n         in Senate Appropriations, we remain strongly opposed for the following reasons:\n             • An advance notice of a price increase will lead to stockpiling by purchasers across\n                the country and consequent shortages, negatively impacting patients and\n                encouraging secondary “gray markets” where prices can fluctuate erratically;\n             • By requesting information only on increases and spending, as well as ignoring the\n                role of major players in the cost of medicine (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers) and\n                the impact of offsets (e.g., rebates and avoided care), the bill would give an\n                incomplete view of costs;\n             • The bill would still require proprietary information from our members; and\n             • The bill applies significantly different standards to brand versus generic medicines\n                (i.e., 10 versus 25 percent increase thresholds), as well as to insurers and the makers\n                of these medicines (e.g., aggregate versus drug-specific reporting), further distorting\n                the cost picture and raising questions of fairness.\n\n         More broadly, SB 1010 has a much greater potential to harm than help patients. In addition to the\n         risks posed by shortages, we assert that the bill will create more upward than downward pressure\n         on medicine prices, while failing to create an accurate picture of costs.\n\n         Medicines are an investment in health and should not be treated solely as short-term\n         expenditures. Looking forward, experts have projected the annual change in prescription\n         spending to remain largely consistent with that of healthcare overall through 20241 as insurers,\n         pharmacy benefit managers (PBM), and other large purchasers will continue to negotiate\n         discounts, rebates, and other concessions on medicines, offsetting, on average, four-fifths of any\n\n\n\n\n         1\n          Kaiser Family Foundation.

Bills like SB 1010,\n         which regard new treatments and cures as only new costs, create a policy environment where\n         creating these cures becomes increasingly difficult for the life sciences industry.\n         For the reasons above, we request a “NO” vote on SB 1010.\n\n         Sincerely,\n\n\n\n\n         Eve Bukowski, VP of State Government Relations, California Life Sciences Association\n\n\n         Cc:       Members of the Assembly Health Committee\n\n\n\n\n         2\n          IMS Health. Medicines Use and Spending in the U.S. – A Review of 2015 and Outlook to 2020.

Vertex is the developer of two new breakthrough medicines,\n         Kalydeco and Orkambi that are the first to treat the underlying cause of Cystic Fibrosis (CF). CF is an\n         inherited, rare disease that is present from birth and affects people throughout their entire life. There is\n         no cure for CF and managing its symptoms and complications is complex and time-consuming. CF is a\n         progressive and life-limiting disease that significantly affects quality of life. A child with CF will\n         experience about a forty percent decline in lung function between the ages of six and thirty. Lung\n         disease is the primary cause of death for people with CF; but the disease affects more than just the\n         lungs. The median predicted age of survival for a person with CF today is 41 years, but today’s median\n         age at death is in the late twenties.\n\n         The                 Committee is going to hold a hearing on drug pricing to discuss the cost of\n         prescription drugs (or insert topic). I am somewhat concerned that Vertex and its breakthrough\n         medicine, ORKAMBI® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor), might be mentioned at the hearing because of its list price.\n         There is a great deal of discussion these days about drug pricing. Some of it is accurate, some of it is\n         inaccurate, and some relevant information may be missing. I am sharing this information to make you\n         aware of pertinent points regarding innovative drugs that treat people with rare diseases.\n\n         Rare diseases, like CF, impact very few people, so there can be fewer business incentives (relative to\n         high prevalence diseases) for a company to spend large amounts of research and development dollars\n         on medications to treat them. This is especially true when one considers the enormous odds of failure.\n         It can be challenging for those companies that invest in finding cures for rare diseases to recoup their\n         investment – let alone make a profit\n\n         SOME FACTS:\n             1. ORKAMBI® is a remarkable innovation which will help about 8,500 in the US people with certain\n                genetic mutations of CF who have no other option that treats the underlying cause of the\n                disease.\n             2. In <insert State name>, there are approximately only <insert State-specific number> individuals\n                on Medicaid and <insert State-specific number> individuals in managed care Medicaid plans who\n                are 12 years and older and have the CF gene mutation that ORKAMBI® has been approved to\n                treat.\n             3. Vertex continues to invest a significant portion of its revenue to further research and\n                development of innovative medicines for the treatment of CF and other diseases. Vertex has\n                invested billions of dollars researching and developing new medicines since its founding in 1989.\n             4. In 2015, Vertex spent 97 percent of its revenue on research and development (R&D). Over the\n                past 5 years (2011-2015), Vertex spent on average 73% of its sales revenue on R&D.\n\n        Discussion about drug costs tends to be one-sided. If this occurs, I think it would be helpful in creating a\n        more balanced perspective if the above points were brought up.\n\n        Thanks again for listening to me.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f                                No Ji- MEASUR E           M ISL EAD ING\n\n     Key Facts About\n     The Misleading State Government Drug Purchasing Initiative\n\n         Controversial activist Michael Weinstein is behind a     The measure is unworkable and could cost\n     misleading initiative proposed for California's November     taxpayers millions in bureaucracy, red tape\n     2016 ballot.

Findings. The legislature finds and declares:\n\n\n   a. A rare disease is defined as a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 people. Rare\n      diseases are sometimes called orphan diseases. There are 7,000 known rare diseases\n      affecting approximately 30 million men, women and children in the United States;\n   b. The exact cause for many rare diseases remains unknown. However, 80% of rare\n      diseases are genetic in origin and can be linked to mutations in a single gene or in\n      multiple genes. Such diseases are referred to as genetic diseases. Genetic disease can\n      be passed down from generation to generation, explaining why certain rare diseases\n      run in families. It is also estimated that about half of all rare diseases affect children;\n   c. A person suffering with a rare disease in the [Your State] faces a wide range of\n      challenges, including, but not limited to: delays in obtaining a diagnosis; misdiagnosis;\n      shortage of medical specialists familiar with, and can provide treatment for, rare\n      diseases; prohibitive cost of treatment; and the inability to access therapies and\n      medication that are used by doctors to treat rare diseases but have not been approved\n      by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that specific purpose;\n   d. In recent years, researchers have made considerable progress in developing diagnostic\n      tools and treatment protocols for, and in discovering ways to prevent a variety of, rare\n      diseases. However, much more remains to be done in the areas of rare disease research\n      and the search for and development of new therapeutics; and\n   e. It is, therefore, an appropriate public policy for [Your State] to establish an advisory\n      body, whose membership would be comprised of persons with suitable qualifications\n      for this purpose, including persons living with rare diseases, to educate medical\n      professionals, government agencies, and the public about rare diseases as an important\n      public health issue, and to encourage and fund research in the development of new\n        treatments for rare diseases.\n\n\n   Version 2 2/2017\n\fSECTION 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF A RARE DISEASE ADVISORY COUNCIL\n\nThere is established the [Your State] Rare Disease Advisory Council in [Your State\nDepartment of Health].\n\n\na. The advisory council shall consist of members as follows:\n(1) Directors, or ex officio members, of [Your State Department of Health] and other state agencies concerned with the\nprovision of care to persons with rare diseases; and\n(2) Public members to be appointed by the Director of the State Department of\nHealth, who shall include:\n\ni. two physicians licensed to practice in [Your State] who have expertise in treating patients with rare diseases, one of\nwhom shall be a pediatrician who provides care to children with rare diseases;\nii. a registered professional nurse licensed in [Your State] who has expertise in providing care to patients with rare\ndiseases;\niii. two representatives of hospitals in [Your State];\niv. a representative of the health insurance industry;\nv. a representative of the biopharmaceutical industry;\nvi. a representative of the scientific community who is engaged in rare disease research;\nvii. two parents of a child with a rare disease;\nviii.two persons with a rare disease;\nix. two patient organizations that operate within [Your State].\n\n\n(3) Upon or after the Advisory Council is first convened, the council may advise [Your State Department of Health] on\nadditional at-large appointments to the council that may be necessary to carry out its duties. At-large appointments to\nthe council may serve on an ad-hoc basis.\n\nb. Vacancies in the membership of the Advisory Council shall be filled in the same manner provided for the original\nappointments. The public members of the Council shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for travel\nand other miscellaneous expenses necessary to perform their duties within the limits of funds made available to the\nCouncil for its purposes.\nc. The council shall organize as soon as practicable after the appointment of its members and shall select a chairperson\nand vice-chairperson from among its members. The chairperson shall appoint a secretary who need not be a member of\nthe council.\nd. The council shall meet periodically, but at least 3 times annually. The council shall be entitled to call to its assistance,\nand avail itself of the services of the employees of, any State, county, or municipal department, board, bureau,\ncommission, or agency as it\nmay require and as may be available to it for its purposes.\ne.

This also makes it challenging for the public to meaningful prepare\n               any testimony for the meeting.\n          •    Consideration for Stakeholder Input Limited: Rarely is stakeholder input from key\n               institutions in the state discussed in a public setting. General practice is to accept PBM\n               and staff recommendation.\n          •    Heavy Reliance on PBMs: The state often adopts coverage criteria recommended by\n               their PBM without doing an independent review to confirm initial recommendations are\n               clinically appropriate.\n          •    Lack of Flexibility: If you do not arrive when the meeting starts, you forfeit your right to\n               testify. One physician wishing to provide clinical input drove 6 hours to testify and after\n               arriving 10 minutes late was denied any participation.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	Iowa.pdf	PDF	21	152	f	2017-08-14 06:16:42.199596	2017-08-21 07:03:17.932812	t	324178	1	317 KB

Initial PBM\n            recommendations have at times fallen outside FDA-approved label.\n        •   Little Opportunity for Public Comment: Attendees are not allowed to comment on the\n            posted initial recommendations for products under review. The public is allowed 5\n            minutes for testimony; however, it is limited to the beginning of each meeting. This\n            limits the opportunity to respond to product-specific questions and to ensure all clinical\n            information discussed is correct.\n        •   Delay during Policy Review: There can be a 120-180 day moratorium on approvals for\n            newly approved FDA products while the PAC reviews and ultimately implements\n            coverage criteria. Interim access has not historically been granted. Such a moratorium\n            policy has not historically been applied to product label expansions.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	Tennessee.pdf	PDF	21	153	f	2017-08-14 06:16:58.225474	2017-08-21 07:03:18.019873	t	325469	1	318 KB

However, specialty drugs are not\n      reviewed by the committee and prior authorization is decided upon by key staff members at\n      Wisconsin DHS.\n\n\n\n      Process Evaluation\n      What doesn’t Work?\n\n           •   Heavy Reliance on PBMs: Wisconsin adopted Magellan’s initial prior authorization\n               recommendations around FEV1 restrictions for ORKAMBI. Although these restrictions\n               were eventually rescinded, tremendous engagement from the physician community was\n               required.\n           •   High Staff Discretion in Place of Committee Review: For specialty drugs, DHS staff make\n               the prior authorization recommendations in place of the publically-appointed\n               committee who make decisions on PDL drugs. This creates a non-transparent process\n               with little to no input or recorded testimony from physician experts or the patient\n               community.\n           •   Little Opportunity for Expert Input: State review process does not include consistent\n               consideration of expert stakeholder input, which can, and has, led to coverage\n               determinations outside of physician community standards of care.\n           •   Lack of Notification: For PDL drugs that are reviewed by the committee, the process is\n               still challenging. Although speaking requests must be made 45 days prior to the\n               meeting, drug classes up for review are only announced 10 days before.\n           •   Non-Transparent Decision Making: Committee decisions are frequently made outside of\n               public hearings and official policy is not announced until it is subsequently posted in the\n               provider bulletin.\n           •   No Appeals Process: The only appeals process as it relates to the action of the\n               Committee is to have the issue addressed at a subsequent meeting where new\n               information could be provided.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	Wisconsin.pdf	PDF	21	154	f	2017-08-14 06:17:14.031958	2017-08-21 07:03:18.180145	t	326844	1	319 KB

The board\n      reviews and approves drug use criteria for both retrospective and prospective drug use, applies\n      this criteria and standards in the application of DUR activities, reviews and reports the results of\n      DURs, and recommends and evaluates educational intervention programs.\n\n\n\n      Process Evaluation\n      What doesn’t Work\n\n           •   Decisions Made Outside of Board Hearing: Although the DUR Board votes on criteria in\n               public meetings, criteria decisions are largely made prior to the meeting behind closed\n               doors. Board members may be privy to briefing documents not available to the public at\n               large.\n           •   Heavy Reliance on PBMs: Vermont relies on their PBM to effectively run the DUR\n               process, and answer questions from engaged members of the public outside the\n               meetings.\n           •   Lack of Advance Notification: Products up for review are rarely published in advance of\n               public meeting, or within 24 hours of the meeting, hindering ability to adequately\n               prepare.\n           •   Limited Expert Testimony: Physicians and other experts not broadly granted ability to\n               provide public testimony. There is no guarantee that expert stakeholders present at the\n               meeting will be granted the ability to speak, and for sufficient time.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 2 2/2017\n\f	Vermont.pdf	PDF	21	155	f	2017-08-14 06:17:28.402048	2017-08-21 07:03:18.262435	t	322686	1	315 KB
